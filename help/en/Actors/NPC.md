# NPCs

The only notable difference between [Characters](Help/Actors/Character) and
NPCs, is that NPCs _give_ experience points, and Characters _earn_ experience
points, which is represented in the top-right of their sheets.

NPCs also by default do not care about proficiencies (as per RAW), though there is a system setting to enable this functionality for them.

## Sheets

### NPC Sheet

Same as PC sheet except displays CR and experience reward on the summary tab.

### NPC Lite Sheet

Bare bones sheet with special handling for minimalist actor handling.

### Loot

Simple container sheet to ease looting monsters after they're defeated. Can also function for party storage or similar uses.

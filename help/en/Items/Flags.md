# Flags

Flags can be used by modules and macros.
Boolean Flags don't do anything by themselves, but Dictionary Flags can be used in rolls, in addition to their use in macros and modules.

## Dictionary Flags

You can access Dictionary Flags within rolls by using `@dFlags.(itemTag).(flagName)`, or with `@item.dFlags.(flagName)` within the current item.

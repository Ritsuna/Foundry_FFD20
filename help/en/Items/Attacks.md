# Attacks

Attacks are types of items that can be used to roll various types of attacks
without requiring a physical weapon. Examples include natural attacks and
attacks generated from weapons.

Aside from not being a physical item and lacking physical properties, they
function very similar to [Weapons](Help/Items/Weapons).

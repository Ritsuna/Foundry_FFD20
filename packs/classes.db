He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Spells&nbsp;(See Spellbooks below)</strong>: A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his opposed schools, if any; see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new wizard level) for his spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to his own (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Spells Gained at a New Level</strong>: Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new wizard level, he gains two spells of his choice to add to his spellbook. The two free spells must be of spell levels he can cast.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bonus_Languages\"><a name=\"TOC-Bonus-Languages\"></a>Bonus Languages</span></h2>\n<p>A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Arcane_Bond_Ex_or_Sp\">Arcane Bond (Ex or Sp)</span></h2>\n<p>At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;bonded object. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;is a magical pet that enhances the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a&nbsp;bonded object&nbsp;is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Rules for bonded items are given below, while rules for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiars</a>&nbsp;are located here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">Familiars</a>.</p>\n<p>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be held in one hand. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\" rel=\"nofollow\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.</p>\n<p>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>&nbsp;or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-School\">arcane school</a>&nbsp;below).</p>\n<p>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">Item Creation Feats</a>&nbsp;and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/craft-magic-arms-and-armor-item-creation\">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>&nbsp;feat). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.</p>\n<p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.</p>\n<h2>Arcane School</h2>\n<p>A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;school instead.</p>\n<p>A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/evocation\">evocation</a>&nbsp;as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fireball\">fireball</a>. In addition, a specialist takes a –4 penalty on any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks\" rel=\"nofollow\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;wizard can prepare spells from any school without restriction.</p>\n<p>Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard’s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;school do not receive a school slot.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Elemental_Arcane_Schools\">Elemental Arcane Schools</span></h2>\n<p>Instead of specializing in a focused arcane school of magic, a wizard can choose to specialize in one of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools\">elemental schools of magic</a>. Like a normal arcane school, an elemental school grants a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental school’s spell list. Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools/air\">air</a>&nbsp;opposes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools/earth\">earth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools/fire\">fire</a>&nbsp;opposes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools/water\">water</a>). He does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cantrips\"><a name=\"TOC-Cantrips\"></a>Cantrips</span></h2>\n<p>Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Wizard&nbsp;under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from an opposition school, but it uses up two of his available slots (see below).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Scribe_Scroll\"><a name=\"TOC-Scribe-Scroll\"></a>Scribe Scroll</span></h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a wizard gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/scribe-scroll-item-creation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scribe Scroll</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bonus_Feats\"><a name=\"TOC-Bonus-Feats\"></a>Bonus Feats</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feat</a>, an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">item creation</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-mastery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spell Mastery</a>. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">Item Creation Feats</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">Metamagic Feats</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-mastery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spell Mastery</a>&nbsp;when choosing those feats.</p>\n<p>A wizard may also choose an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/\">Arcane Discovery</a>&nbsp;that he qualifies for in place of a bonus feat at these levels.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-magenta-3.jpg","effects":[]}

By way of the druidic discipline of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Shape-Su-\">wild shape</a>, they become living aspects of the wild.

Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>\n<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms.

A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ironwood\">ironwood</a>&nbsp;spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>\n<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Shape-Su-\">wild shape</a>, and other shifter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-\">supernatural</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like abilities</a>&nbsp;while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A shifter’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey\">fey</a>&nbsp;or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>\n<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>&nbsp;and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>&nbsp;or non-shifters.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>—the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>&nbsp;as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>\n<h2>Shifter Aspect (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Aspects\">aspect</a>—a category of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect’s minor form (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Aspects\">Aspects</a>) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, while ending the effect is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;that can be taken only on the shifter’s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Chimeric-Aspect-Su-\">chimeric aspect</a>&nbsp;class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Aspects\">aspect</a>&nbsp;(or aspects, in the case of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Chimeric-Aspect-Su-\">chimeric aspects</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Greater-Chimeric-Aspect-Su-\">greater chimeric aspects</a>) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph\">polymorph</a>&nbsp;effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph\">polymorph</a>&nbsp;effects.</p>\n<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Aspects\">aspects</a>; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Shifter Claws (Su)</h2>\n<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter’s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attack</a>, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attack</a>&nbsp;instead.</p>\n<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, her claws count as magic weapons<a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1hj#v5748eaic9wan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">SOURCE</a>, ignore&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>/<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold\">cold iron</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes ×3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>/<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>/—.</p>\n<p>While a shifter uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Shape-Su-\">wild shape</a>&nbsp;to assume her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Aspects\">aspect</a>‘s major form, her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attacks</a>&nbsp;gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form’s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attacks</a>&nbsp;that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>\n<h2>Wild Empathy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;check to improve the attitude of a person. The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier to determine the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-\">wild empathy</a>&nbsp;check result. The typical domestic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;are usually unfriendly.</p>\n<p>To use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-\">wild empathy</a>, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>\n<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast\">magical beast</a>&nbsp;with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Instinct (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;bonus (if any) to her AC and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>&nbsp;at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>\n<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;attacks and when the shifter is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>. These bonuses do not stack with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>&nbsp;AC bonus class feature.</p>\n<h2>Track (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks to follow tracks.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed\">speed</a>&nbsp;and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>\n<h2>Wild Shape (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Aspects\">aspects</a>&nbsp;and back again. This ability functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Aspects\">aspects</a>&nbsp;at a time. Using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Shape-Su-\">wild shape</a>&nbsp;to change to a major form or back is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that doesn’t provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Often a particular aspect’s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>, but she still gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>&nbsp;abilities that are size dependent.</p>\n<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;of that form can make, but she can communicate with other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>\n<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on ‘uses of wild shape,’ each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>\n<p>Shifters can take feats and other abilities that require&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Shape-Su-\">wild shape</a>; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;level is equal to her shifter level.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>\n<h2>Shifter's Fury (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a –5 as if it was a manufactured weapon.

Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called rogues.</p>\n<p>Role: Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat. Their varied skills and abilities allow them to be highly versatile, with great variations in expertise existing between different rogues.

The Difficulty Class for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an oracle’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the oracle’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Oracle. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle’s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Oracle Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score; the numbers on&nbsp;Table: Oracle Spells Known&nbsp;are fixed.</p>\n<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with “cure” in the name, inflict spells include all spells with “inflict” in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery. Unlike a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on&nbsp;Table: Oracle Spells Known. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>\n<p>Each oracle must choose from among the following mysteries.</p>\n<ul class=\"ogn-childpages\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px;

The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon’s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures.

He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.

The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level summoner spell he can cast.

Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats#TOC-Metamagic-Feats\">metamagic</a>&nbsp;feats, for example, consume spell slots as normally.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon</h2>\n<p>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it and can speak all of his languages. Eidolons are treated as summoned creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/protection-from-evil\">protection from evil</a>&nbsp;and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>\n<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;are unchanged from the last time it was dismissed or banished. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a>, but spells such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dismissal\">dismissal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/banishment\">banishment</a>&nbsp;work normally. If the summoner is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished. The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner’s desires. The eidolon’s Hit Dice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner’s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon receives a pool of evolution points, based on the summoner’s class level, that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>\n<p>The eidolon’s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner’s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alter-self\">alter self</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph\">polymorph</a>&nbsp;(although&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility\">invisibility</a>&nbsp;does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full details on how eidolons work can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner/eidolons\">Eidolons</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Life Link (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>\n<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.</p>\n<h2>Summon Monster I (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, a summoner can cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster I</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like ability</a>&nbsp;a number of times per day equal to 3 + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this ability when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster IX</a>&nbsp;at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate\">gate</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster IX</a>. If used as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate\">gate</a>, the summoner must pay any required material&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate\">gate</a>&nbsp;spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate\">gate</a>&nbsp;immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of his spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, he can expend uses of this ability to fufill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>\n<h2>Bond Senses (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a summoner can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>.</p>\n<h2>Shield Ally (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon’s reach, the summoner receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Shield-Bonus\">shield bonus</a>&nbsp;to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">Armor Class</a>&nbsp;and a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled\">grappled</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>.</p>\n<h2>Maker's Call (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door\">dimension door</a>, using the summoner’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. When used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>\n<h2>Transposition (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker’s call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If it is larger than him, he can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>\n<h2>Aspect (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon’s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well. He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon’s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions he receives from these points any time he can change the eidolon’s evolutions.</p>\n<h2>Greater Shield Ally (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within an eidolon’s reach, the ally receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Shield-Bonus\">shield bonus</a>&nbsp;to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">Armor Class</a>&nbsp;and a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled\">grappled</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>.</p>\n<h2>Life Bond (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, a summoner’s life becomes linked to his eidolon’s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner.</p>\n<p>Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like baleful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph\">polymorph</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/flesh-to-stone\">flesh to stone</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/imprisonment\">imprisonment</a>, or other spells that do not cause actual damage.</p>\n<h2>Merge Forms (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner’s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>\n<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>&nbsp;used for these spells are taken from the summoner’s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon’s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>\n<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, taking 4d6 points of damage, and is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>&nbsp;for 1 round.</p>\n<h2>Greater Aspect (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon’s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but up to 6 evolution points can be taken. Unlike the aspect ability, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner.</p>\n<h2>Twin Eidolon (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon’s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_26.jpg","effects":[]}

These attacks can be any combination of unarmed strikes and attacks with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>&nbsp;special weapon (he does not need to use two weapons to utilize this ability).</p>\n<p>For the purpose of these attacks, the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;from his monk class levels is equal to his monk level. For all other purposes, such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, the monk uses his normal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when he uses flurry of blows, as if using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;(even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).</p>\n<p>At 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using flurry of blows, as if using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/greater-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;(even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).</p>\n<p>A monk applies his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;bonus to his damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands.

A monk’s attacks may be with fist, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.</p>\n<p>Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;instead with no penalty on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. He has the same choice to deal lethal or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grappling</a>.</p>\n<p>A monk’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapons</a>.</p>\n<p>A monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown above on&nbsp;Table: Monk. The unarmed damage values listed on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TABLE-Monk\">Table: Monk</a>&nbsp;are for Medium monks.

When first gaining this ability, he takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk’s ability to slow his fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with his monk level until at 20th level he can use a nearby wall to slow his descent and fall any distance without harm.</p>\n<h2>High Jump (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a monk adds his level to all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>&nbsp;checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, he always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>. By spending 1 point from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a monk gains a +20 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>&nbsp;checks made to jump for 1 round.</p>\n<h2>Purity of Body (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-\">immunity</a>&nbsp;to all diseases, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-\">supernatural</a>&nbsp;and magical diseases.</p>\n<h2>Wholeness of Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. He can heal a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;of damage equal to his monk level by using 2 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 9th level, a monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>&nbsp;ability improves.

A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;monk does not gain the benefit of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Evasion-Ex-\">improved evasion</a>.</p>\n<h2>Diamond Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-\">immunity</a>&nbsp;to poisons of all kinds.</p>\n<h2>Abundant Step (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door\">dimension door</a>. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;that consumes 2 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;for this effect is equal to his monk level. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability.</p>\n<h2>Diamond Soul (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to his current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;check (1d20 +&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>) that equals or exceeds the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>.</p>\n<h2>Quivering Palm (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his intent before making his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>), and unless the target makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;(DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wis</a>&nbsp;modifier), it dies. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is negated.</p>\n<h2>Timeless Body (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>\n<h2>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</p>\n<h2>Empty Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/etherealness\">etherealness</a>. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;that consumes 3 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool. This ability only affects the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures ethereal.</p>\n<h2>Perfect Self</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsider</a>&nbsp;rather than as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoid</a>&nbsp;(or whatever the monk’s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects.

When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>\n<p><strong>Unchained:</strong> While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue’s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit

In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score.</p>\n<p>The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the bard’s choice. At each new bard level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>A bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.</p>\n<h2>Bardic Knowledge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A bard adds half his class level (minimum 1) to all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill checks and may make all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill checks untrained.</p>\n<h2>Bardic Performance</h2>\n<p>A bard is trained to use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.</p>\n<p>Starting a bardic performance is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, but it can be maintained each round as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>, knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, or otherwise prevented from taking a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>.</p>\n<p>Each bardic performance has audible&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>, visual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>, or both.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened\">deaf</a>&nbsp;bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded\">blind</a>&nbsp;bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.</p>\n<p>List of Bardic Performances:</p>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Countersong-Su-\"></a><strong>Countersong (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a bard learns to counter magic effects that depend on sound (but not spells that have verbal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.) Each round of the countersong he makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;(keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.</p>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Distraction-Su-\"></a><strong>Distraction (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, he makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;(act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion\">illusion</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Pattern\">pattern</a>) or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion\">illusion</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Figment\">figment</a>) magical attack may use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result proves to be higher.

Distraction does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.</p>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Fascinate-Su-\"></a><strong>Fascinate (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated\">fascinated</a>&nbsp;with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The Distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability.</p>\n<p>Each creature within range receives a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Cha</a>&nbsp;modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated\">fascinated</a>, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.</p>\n<p>Fascinate is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment\">enchantment</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion\">compulsion</a>), mind-affecting ability.

At 5th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The bard must choose which component to use when starting his performance.</p>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Inspire-Competence-Su-\"></a><strong>Inspire Competence (Su)</strong>: A bard of 3rd level or higher can use his performance to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The ally gets a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Competence-Bonus\">competence bonus</a>&nbsp;on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the bard’s performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th).</p>\n<p>Certain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a>, and may be disallowed at the GM’s discretion. A bard can’t inspire competence in himself. inspire competence relies on audible components.</p>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Suggestion-Sp-\"></a><strong>Suggestion (Sp)</strong>: A bard of 6th level or higher can use his performance to make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion\">suggestion</a>&nbsp;(as per the spell) to a creature that he has already&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated\">fascinated</a>&nbsp;(see above). Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to activate (in addition to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;to continue the fascinate effect).

Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature’s wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any neutral</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 2d6 × 10 gp (average 70 gp.)

and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>\n<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ironwood\">ironwood</a>&nbsp;spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.</p>\n<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-druid\">druid spell list</a>. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting</h2>\n<p>A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spell of the same level or lower.</p>\n<h2>Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells</h2>\n<p>A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Orisons (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Druid&nbsp;under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>\n<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>\n<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>\n<h2>Nature Bond (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/air-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Air</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/animal-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Animal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/earth-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/fire-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fire</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/plant-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plant</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/water-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Water</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/weather-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weather</a>. Druids also have access to a set of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/archetypes/paizo-druid-archetypes/animal-and-terrain-domains\">Animal and Terrain Domains</a>. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid’s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Animal-Choices\">Animal Choices</a>. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>\n<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion’s Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>\n<h2>Nature Sense (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(nature) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks.</p>\n<h2>Wild Empathy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>. This ability functions just like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p>\n<p>The typical domestic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;are usually unfriendly.</p>\n<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>\n<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>\n<h2>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that target plants, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight\">blight</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/entangle\">entangle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spike-growth\">spike growth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/warp-wood\">warp wood</a>.</p>\n<h2>Wild Shape (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;type. This ability functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape I</a>&nbsp;spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>\n<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>\n<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level.

Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters’ abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results.

She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.

Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Sorcerer. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#table-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>A sorcerer’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new sorcerer level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score; the numbers on&nbsp;Table: Sorcerer Spells Known&nbsp;are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of through study.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the sorcerer loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>Unlike a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;a sorcerer need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>\n<h2>Bloodline</h2>\n<p>Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in her heritage that grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional class skill, and other special abilities. This source can represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family’s past. For example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on&nbsp;Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>\n<p>Filled with magical power that screams for release, sorcery is not so much a calling as a blessing—or a curse. For some sorcerers, this arcane birthright manifests in subtle and carefully controlled ways, assisting in their manipulation of others or the pursuit of lofty goals. For others, it is wild and unpredictable, the primal and explosive lashing out of a power greater than themselves. Presented below are a number of bloodlines representing the mysterious origin of your sorcerer’s abilities.</p>\n<p>The following bloodlines represent only some of the possible sources of power that a sorcerer can draw upon. Unless otherwise noted, most sorcerers are assumed to have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/bloodlines/bloodlines-from-paizo/arcane-bloodline\">arcane bloodline</a>.</p>\n<p>Bloodline Mutations: Although heirs to similar arcane bloodlines may share commonalities, the unique circumstances in which a bloodline enters a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager\">bloodrager</a>&nbsp;or sorcerer’s lineage can result in the manifestation of particularly strange or unusual bloodline powers known as mutations. Whenever a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager\">bloodrager</a>&nbsp;or a sorcerer gains a new bloodline power, she can swap her bloodline power for a bloodline mutation whose prerequisites she meets. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager\">bloodrager</a>&nbsp;or sorcerer cannot swap a bloodline power that she has altered or replaced with an archetype for a bloodline mutation. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager\">bloodrager</a>&nbsp;need not be in a bloodrage to use her bloodline mutation powers. Alternatively, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager\">bloodrager</a>&nbsp;or sorcerer can select a bloodline mutation in place of a bloodline bonus feat, provided her class level is at least equal to the level of the bloodline ability the mutation normally replaces.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fireball-red-3.jpg","effects":[]}

Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats#TOC-Metamagic-Feats\">metamagic</a>&nbsp;feats, for example, consume spell slots as normally.</p>\n<h2>Eidolon</h2>\n<p>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it and can speak all of his languages. Eidolons are treated as summoned creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/protection-from-evil\">protection from evil</a>&nbsp;and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>\n<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;are unchanged from the last time it was dismissed or banished. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a>, but spells such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dismissal\">dismissal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/banishment\">banishment</a>&nbsp;work normally. If the summoner is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished. The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner’s desires. The eidolon’s Hit Dice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner’s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon receives a pool of evolution points, based on the summoner’s class level, that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>\n<p>The eidolon’s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner’s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alter-self\">alter self</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph\">polymorph</a>&nbsp;(although&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility\">invisibility</a>&nbsp;does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full details on how eidolons work can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner/eidolons\">Eidolons</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Life Link (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>\n<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.</p>\n<h2>Summon Monster I (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, a summoner can cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster I</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like ability</a>&nbsp;a number of times per day equal to 3 + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this ability when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster IX</a>&nbsp;at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate\">gate</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster IX</a>. If used as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate\">gate</a>, the summoner must pay any required material&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate\">gate</a>&nbsp;spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate\">gate</a>&nbsp;immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of his spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, he can expend uses of this ability to fufill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>\n<h2>Bond Senses (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a summoner can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>.</p>\n<h2>Shield Ally (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon’s reach, the summoner receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Shield-Bonus\">shield bonus</a>&nbsp;to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">Armor Class</a>&nbsp;and a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled\">grappled</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>.</p>\n<h2>Maker's Call (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door\">dimension door</a>, using the summoner’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. When used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>\n<h2>Transposition (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker’s call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If it is larger than him, he can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>\n<h2>Aspect (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon’s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well. He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon’s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions he receives from these points any time he can change the eidolon’s evolutions.</p>\n<h2>Greater Shield Ally (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within an eidolon’s reach, the ally receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Shield-Bonus\">shield bonus</a>&nbsp;to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">Armor Class</a>&nbsp;and a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled\">grappled</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>.</p>\n<h2>Life Bond (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, a summoner’s life becomes linked to his eidolon’s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner.</p>\n<p>Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like baleful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph\">polymorph</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/flesh-to-stone\">flesh to stone</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/imprisonment\">imprisonment</a>, or other spells that do not cause actual damage.</p>\n<h2>Merge Forms (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner’s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>\n<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>&nbsp;used for these spells are taken from the summoner’s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon’s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>\n<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, taking 4d6 points of damage, and is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>&nbsp;for 1 round.</p>\n<h2>Greater Aspect (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon’s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but up to 6 evolution points can be taken. Unlike the aspect ability, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner.</p>\n<h2>Twin Eidolon (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon’s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_26.jpg","effects":[]}

and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bloodline</h2>\n<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family’s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager’s alignment doesn’t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager/bloodrager-bloodlines/paizo-bloodrager-bloodlines/abyssal\">abyssal bloodline</a>, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager/bloodrager-bloodlines/paizo-bloodrager-bloodlines/infernal\">infernal bloodline</a>&nbsp;could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn’t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>\n<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like</a>&nbsp;bloodline powers, treat the character’s bloodrager level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>.</p>\n<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>\n<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/Bloodrager/#TOC-Bloodline\">bloodline</a>&nbsp;to make them conform.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Mutations</strong>: Although heirs to similar arcane bloodlines may share commonalities, the unique circumstances in which a bloodline enters a bloodrager or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer’s</a>&nbsp;lineage can result in the manifestation of particularly strange or unusual bloodline powers known as mutations. Whenever a bloodrager or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;gains a new bloodline power, she can swap her bloodline power for a bloodline mutation whose prerequisites she meets. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager\">bloodrager</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;cannot swap a bloodline power that she has altered or replaced with an archetype for a bloodline mutation. A bloodrager need not be in a bloodrage to use her bloodline mutation powers. Alternatively, a bloodrager or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;can select a bloodline mutation in place of a bloodline bonus feat, provided her class level is at least equal to the level of the bloodline ability the mutation normally replaces.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/bloodlines/bloodline-mutations\">The list of bloodline mutations can be found here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bloodrager Bloodlines</h2>\n<p>When a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, he often takes on a physical transformation influenced by his bloodline and powered by the magic that roils within him. Unless otherwise specified, he gains the effects of his bloodline powers only while in a bloodrage; once the bloodrage ends, all powers from his bloodline immediately cease, and any physical changes the bloodrager underwent revert, restoring him to normal.</p>\n<ul class=\"ogn-childpages\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>\n<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>, as well as a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves. In addition, he takes a –2 penalty to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">Armor Class</a>. The increase to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;grants the bloodrager 2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Die</a>, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>.

When the bloodrage ends, he’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>&nbsp;for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted\">exhausted</a>, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>\n<p>Bloodrage counts as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarian’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-\">rage</a>&nbsp;class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>\n<h2>Fast Movement (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A bloodrager’s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager’s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager’s land speed.</p>\n<h2>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>, nor does he lose his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if the attacker is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible\">invisible</a>. He still loses his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Feint\">feint</a>&nbsp;action against him.</p>\n<p>If a bloodrager already possesses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;from a different class, he automatically gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">improved uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;(see below) instead.</p>\n<h2>Blood Sanctuary (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>\n<h2>Blood Casting (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>\n<h2>Eschew Materials</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/eschew-materials\">Eschew Materials</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>Spell Casting</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/bloodrager\">bloodrager spell list</a>. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score. The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn’t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.</p>\n<p>The bloodrager’s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline.&nbsp;At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;

and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>An inquisitor is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, longbow, repeating crossbow, shortbow, and the favored weapon of her deity. She is also proficient with light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and shields (except tower shields).</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>An inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-inquisitor\">inquisitor spell list</a>. She can cast any spell she knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a spell, an inquisitor must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an inquisitor’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>An inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Inquisitor. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>An inquisitor’s selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor’s choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score. The numbers on&nbsp;Table: Inquisitor Spells Known&nbsp;are fixed.)</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast. The inquisitor may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>, an inquisitor must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor can select one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM’s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor. Levels of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;and inquisitor stack for the purpose of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for bonus spells.</p>\n<p>A complete listing of domains can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">Domains</a>. Inquisitors also have access to Inquisitions, which are similar to Domains but do not include Domain spells. A complete listing of Inquisitions can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor/inquisitions\">Inquisitions</a>.</p>\n<h2>Judgement (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, an inquisitor can pronounce judgment upon her foes as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses.

As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil\">evil</a>, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules\">Neutral</a>&nbsp;inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<div>\n<p><a name=\"judgment-destruction\"></a><strong>Destruction</strong>: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Sacred-Bonus\">sacred bonus</a>&nbsp;on all weapon damage rolls.

At 10th level, the inquisitor’s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;(but not for reducing hardness).</p>\n<h2>Monster Lore (Ex)</h2>\n<p>The inquisitor adds her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill checks in addition to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.</p>\n<h2>Orisons</h2>\n<p>Inquisitors learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Orisons prepared using other spell slots, such as those due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats#TOC-Metamagic-Feats\">metamagic</a>&nbsp;feats, are expended normally.</p>\n<h2>Stern Gaze (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Inquisitors are skilled at sensing deception and intimidating their foes. An inquisitor receives a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive\">Sense Motive</a>&nbsp;checks equal to 1/2 her inquisitor level (minimum +1).</p>\n<h2>Cunning Initiative (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks, in addition to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<h2>Detect Alignment (Sp)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, at will, an inquisitor can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-chaos\">detect chaos</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-good\">detect good</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-law\">detect law</a>.

The allies’ positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus.</p>\n<h2>Teamwork Feat</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement.

In effect, the inquisitor loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can only change the most recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;gained. Whenever she gains a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>, the previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;becomes set and cannot be changed again. An inquisitor can change her most recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;a number of times per day equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<h2>Bane (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, an inquisitor can imbue one of her weapons with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/bane/\">bane weapon special ability</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. She must select one creature type when she uses this ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsider</a>). Once selected, the type can be changed as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This ability only functions while the inquisitor wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability if it is returned to the inquisitor before the duration expires. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the inquisitor’s level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>\n<h2>Discern Lies (Sp)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, an inquisitor can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-lies\">discern lies</a>, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.</p>\n<h2>Second Judgement (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects two different judgments, instead of one. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, she can change one of these judgments to another type.</p>\n<h2>Stalwart (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, an inquisitor can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If she makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can only be used if the inquisitor is wearing light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or no armor. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;inquisitor does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>\n<h2>Greater Bane (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her bane ability, the amount of bonus damage dealt by the weapon against creatures of the selected type increases to 4d6.</p>\n<h2>Exploit Weakness (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the inquisitor learns to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself. Whenever the inquisitor scores a critical hit, she ignores any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;the target might have. In addition, if the target has regeneration, the creature loses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-\">regeneration</a>&nbsp;on the round following the critical hit and can die normally during that round. Creatures whose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-\">regeneration</a>&nbsp;always functions are immune to this ability. Finally, if the inquisitor deals energy damage to a creature with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Immunity-and-Vulnerability\">vulnerability</a>&nbsp;to that energy type, she deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.</p>\n<h2>Third Judgement (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects three different judgments, instead of just two. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, the inquisitor can change one of these judgments to another type.</p>\n<h2>Slayer (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, an inquisitor learns to focus her judgment. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she must select one type of judgment. She is treated as if she were 5 levels higher for the purposes of determining the bonus granted by this judgment. Unlike other types of judgment, the one enhanced by this ability cannot be changed for the remainder of the judgment.</p>\n<h2>True Judgement (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, an inquisitor can call true judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, the inquisitor can invoke true judgment on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the inquisitor can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor’s level + the inquisitor’s Wisdom modifier. Regardless of whether or not the save is made, the target creature is immune to the inquisitor’s true judgment ability for 24 hours. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg","effects":[]}

and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor#TOC-Arcane-Spell-Failure-Chance\">arcane spell failure chance</a>. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Spell Casting</h2>\n<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-bard\">bard spell list</a>. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component—these verbal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>&nbsp;can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level.

His base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Skald. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score.</p>\n<p>The skald’s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald’s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Skald Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn’t affected by his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score; the numbers on&nbsp;Table: Skald Spells Known&nbsp;are fixed.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;

At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>\n<p>Starting a raging song is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, but it can be maintained each round as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bard’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Bardic-Performance\">bardic performance</a>&nbsp;special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces.</p>\n<p>A raging song has audible&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>, but not visual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>\n<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally’s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald’s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song’s effects last for that ally’s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.

While under the effects of inspired&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-\">rage</a>, allies other than the skald cannot use any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>-,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>-, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>-based skills (except&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly\">Fly</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride\">Ride</a>) or any ability that requires patience or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song’s bonuses on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn’t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song’s bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;increase by 2.

If an ally has her own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-\">rage</a>&nbsp;class ability (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarian’s</a>&nbsp;rage, bloodrager’s bloodrage, or skald’s inspired rage), she may use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigue</a>&nbsp;afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Powers-Ex-\">rage powers</a>, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>\n<p><strong>Song of Marching (Su)</strong>:&nbsp;At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigue</a>. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigue</a>. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Song of Strength (Su)</strong>:&nbsp;At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald’s level to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;check or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>-based skill check.</p>\n<p><strong>Dirge of Doom (Su)</strong>:&nbsp;At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken\">shaken</a>. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald’s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened\">frightened</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked\">panicked</a>, even if the targets are already&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken\">shaken</a>&nbsp;from another effect. This is a sonic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear\">fear</a>&nbsp;effect, and relies on audible&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Song of the Fallen (Su)</strong>:&nbsp;At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead\">raise dead</a>. The skald selects a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered\">staggered</a>. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Sagas</strong>:&nbsp;Sagas are specialized applications of a skald’s raging song ability, functioning much like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard/bardic-masterpieces/masterpieces\">bardic masterpieces</a>&nbsp;but are available only to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/skald\">skalds</a>. Sagas are never purely artistic constructs; they are designed to preserve lore or commemorate historical figures, and are usually based in fact. Sagas therefore require ranks in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(history) as a prerequisite, as well.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">Bards</a>&nbsp;can learn sagas, using their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Bardic-Performance\">bardic performance</a>&nbsp;ability instead of raging song.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/skald/skald-sagas\">See list of sagas here.</a></p>\n<h2>Scribe Scroll</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a skald gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/scribe-scroll-item-creation\">Scribe Scroll</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Performance (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;skill associated with the skald class.

In addition, the skald’s effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;level is equal to 1/2 his skald level for the purpose of qualifying for feats that specifically select weapons from those&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;skills’ associated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;weapon groups.

Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bard</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-sorcerer-and-wizard/\">sorcerer/wizard</a>&nbsp;spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Casting-Time\">casting time</a>&nbsp;of 1 full round, regardless of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Casting-Time\">casting time</a>&nbsp;of the spell.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>\n<h2>Lore Master (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20\">take 20</a>&nbsp;on any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill check as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20\">take 20</a>&nbsp;on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>\n<h2>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking\">flanked</a>.

Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attack</a>. At 14th and 19th levels, this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;increases by 1.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-\">Damage Reduction</a>&nbsp;can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>\n<h2>Master Skald (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a skald’s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarian’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Powers-Ex-\">rage powers</a>&nbsp;and a bloodrager’s blood casting and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer#TOC-Bloodline\">bloodline</a>&nbsp;abilities.

She can’t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/read-magic\">read magic</a>&nbsp;(which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>\n<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>/<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizards</a>‘&nbsp;or other arcanists’&nbsp;spellbooks to her own.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on&nbsp;Table: Arcanist Spells Prepared. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Reservoir (Su)</h2>\n<p>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist’s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist’s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist’s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>\n<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist’s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;by 1 or increase the spell’s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Exploits</h2>\n<p>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist’s level + the arcanist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>For a complete list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits\">Arcanist Exploits, see here</a></p>\n<h2>Consume Spells (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell.&nbsp;She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1).&nbsp;Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir’s maximum are lost.</p>\n<h2>Greater Exploits</h2>\n<p>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>\n<p>For a complete list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcanist-greater-exploits/\">Greater Exploits, see here</a></p>\n<h2>Magical Supremacy (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/runes-blue-2.jpg","effects":[]}

The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-\">Difficulty Class</a>&nbsp;for a saving throw against a hunter’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device\">Use Magic Device</a>&nbsp;check) of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;spells of 7th level or higher. Her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score.</p>\n<p>Unlike&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>, a hunter’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score; the numbers on&nbsp;Table: Hunter Spells Known&nbsp;are fixed.</p>\n<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>\n<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spells.</p>\n<p>Unlike a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">ranger</a>, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</strong>: A hunter can’t cast spells of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;

These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Animal Companion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A hunter may begin play with any of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;available to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;ability (which is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Nature-Bond-Ex-\">nature bond</a>&nbsp;class feature). The hunter’s effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;from more than one source, her effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion’s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter’s tricks from the skirmisher&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">ranger</a>&nbsp;archetype instead of standard tricks.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Dice</a>&nbsp;plus its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>, any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;she summons with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;immediately ends.</p>\n<h2>Animal Focus (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>\n<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter’s minutes of duration per day—it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion’s aspect can be the same aspect the hunter has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;as part of the same&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>.</p>\n<p>If the hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>, the hunter can apply her companion’s animal focus to herself instead of her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion’s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Bat</strong>: The creature gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision\">darkvision</a>&nbsp;to a range of 60 feet.

Generally, influencing an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>\n<p>The hunter can also use this ability to influence a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast\">magical beast</a>&nbsp;with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.</p>\n<h2>Precise Companion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat\">Precise Shot</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/outflank-combat-teamwork\">Outflank</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/outflank-combat-teamwork\">Outflank</a>, she automatically grants this feat to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>\n<h2>Track (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>\n<h2>Hunter Tactics (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. The companion doesn’t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>\n<h2>Teamwork Feat</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>\n<p>As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat.

This functions like an empathic link with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-\">familiar</a>, except the hunter can also see through a companion’s eyes as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. The hunter is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded\">blinded</a>&nbsp;while maintaining this connection.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a hunter and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>\n<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Tricks (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter’s effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;level).</p>\n<h2>Second Animal Focus (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion’s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>\n<p>If the hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;and the hunter has applied the companion’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animal-aspect\">animal aspect</a>&nbsp;to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;companion’s aspects to herself, not both.</p>\n<h2>Swift Tracker (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to follow tracks without taking the normal –5 penalty. She takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>\n<h2>Raise Animal Companion (Sp)</h2>\n<p>At 10th level, a hunter gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-animal-companion\">raise animal companion</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like ability</a>; this is not restricted to raising only her own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>.

This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels\">negative level</a>&nbsp;cannot be overcome in any way (including by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration\">restoration</a>), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection\">resurrection</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead\">raise dead</a>, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>\n<h2>Speak with Master (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, a hunter and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>\n<h2>Greater Empathic Link (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the range of the hunter’s empathic link with her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;increases to 10 miles. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>\n<h2>One with the Wild (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, the hunter and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;are respected or even feared by other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>, so long as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter’s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on.

They are also proficient with light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, but not with shields.</p>\n<h2>Alchemy (Su)</h2>\n<p>Alchemists are not only masters of creating mundane alchemical substances such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Alchemist-s-Fire\">alchemist’s fire</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Smokestick\">smokesticks</a>, but also of fashioning magical potion-like extracts in which they can store spell effects. In effect, an alchemist prepares his spells by mixing ingredients into a number of extracts, and then “casts” his spells by drinking the extract. When an alchemist creates an extract or bomb, he infuses the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical power—this enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds the effects to the creator. When using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) to create an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances\">alchemical item</a>, an alchemist gains a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Competence-Bonus\">competence bonus</a>&nbsp;equal to his class level on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) check. In addition, an alchemist can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) to identify potions as if using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic\">detect magic</a>. He must hold the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>&nbsp;for 1 round to make such a check.</p>\n<p>An alchemist can create three special types of magical items—extracts, bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash weapons, and mutagens are transformative elixirs that the alchemist drinks to enhance his physical abilities—both of these are detailed in their own sections below.</p>\n<p>Extracts are the most varied of the three. In many ways, they behave like spells in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>&nbsp;form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by effects like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a>&nbsp;using the alchemist’s level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. Unlike potions, though, extracts can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>&nbsp;normally could not.</p>\n<p>An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts is given on&nbsp;Table: Alchemist. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score, in the same way a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;receives&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\">bonus spells per day</a>. When an alchemist mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately becomes inert if it leaves the alchemist’s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping—an alchemist cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use (but see the “infusion”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Discovery-Su-\">discovery</a>&nbsp;below). An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before becoming inert, so an alchemist must re-prepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work—most alchemists prepare many extracts at the start of the day or just before going on an adventure, but it’s not uncommon for an alchemist to keep some (or even all) of his daily extract slots open so that he can prepare extracts in the field as needed.</p>\n<p>Although the alchemist doesn’t actually cast spells, he does have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/formulae-lists-alchemist\">formulae list</a>&nbsp;that determines what extracts he can create. An alchemist can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on his formulae list, but not spell-completion items (unless he uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device\">Use Magic Device</a>&nbsp;to do so). An extract is “cast” by drinking it, as if imbibing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>—the effects of an extract exactly duplicate the spell upon which its formula is based, save that the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist. The alchemist uses his level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;to determine any effect based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. Creating extracts consumes raw materials, but the cost of these materials is insignificant—comparable to the valueless material&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>&nbsp;of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements (alchemist extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement). An alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an alchemist must have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the extract’s level. The Difficulty Class for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an alchemist’s extract is 10 + the extract level + the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract but not when he consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two 1st level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae equal to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. At each new alchemist level, he gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist can also add formulae to his book just like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs and time requirements. An alchemist can study a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard’s</a>&nbsp;spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An alchemist does not need to decipher arcane writings before copying them.</p>\n<h2>Bomb (Su)</h2>\n<p>In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert—their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst—the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster’s component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day—once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.</p>\n<p>Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Throw Splash Weapon</a>&nbsp;special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/point-blank-shot-combat\">Point-Blank Shot</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>. On a direct hit, an alchemist’s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. The damage of an alchemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/vital-strike-combat\">Vital Strike</a>). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb’s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Discovery-Su-\">Discovery</a>&nbsp;ability) as they level up. An alchemist’s bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p>\n<h2>Brew Potion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, alchemists receive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/brew-potion-item-creation\">Brew Potion</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. An alchemist can brew potions of any formulae he knows (up to 3rd level), using his alchemist level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. The spell must be one that can be made into a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>. The alchemist does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat.</p>\n<h2>Mutagen (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time—if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an alchemist’s possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again.</p>\n<p>When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score—either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>. It’s a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus\">natural armor bonus</a>&nbsp;and a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alchemical-Bonus\">alchemical bonus</a>&nbsp;to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>, it applies a penalty to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>. If it enhances his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>, it applies a penalty to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>. If it enhances his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>, it applies a penalty to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>.</p>\n<p>A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier) or become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated\">nauseated</a>&nbsp;for 1 hour—a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist’s mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.</p>\n<h2>Throw Anything (Ex)</h2>\n<p>All alchemists gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/throw-anything-combat\">Throw Anything</a>&nbsp;feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. An alchemist adds his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Intelligence_Int\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier to damage done with splash weapons, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.</p>\n<h2>Discovery (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of discoveries can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries\">Discoveries</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Poison Resistance (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an alchemist gains a +2 bonus on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and then again to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, an alchemist becomes completely immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>.</p>\n<h2>Poison Use (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Alchemists are trained in the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;and starting at 2nd level, cannot accidentally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;themselves when applying&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon.</p>\n<h2>Swift Alchemy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, an alchemist can create&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances\">alchemical items</a>&nbsp;with astounding speed. It takes an alchemist half the normal amount of time to create&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances\">alchemical items</a>, and he can apply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>.</p>\n<h2>Swift Poisoning (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, an alchemist can apply a dose of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>.</p>\n<h2>Persistent Mutagen (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the effects of a mutagen last for 1 hour per level.</p>\n<h2>Instant Alchemy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, an alchemist can create&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances\">alchemical items</a>&nbsp;with almost supernatural speed. He can create any alchemical item as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>&nbsp;if he succeeds at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources at hand to fund the creation. He can apply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon as an immediate action.</p>\n<h2>Grand Discovery (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the alchemist makes a grand discovery. He immediately learns two normal discoveries, but also learns a third&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Discovery-Su-\">discovery</a>&nbsp;chosen from the linked list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many alchemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of grand discoveries can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries#TOC-Grand-Discoveries\">Grand Discoveries</a></li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg","effects":[]}

An inflict spell is any spell with “inflict” in its name.</p>\n<p>A warpriest that is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil chooses whether he can convert spells into either cure spells or inflict spells. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. This choice also determines whether the warpriest channels positive or negative energy (see Channel Energy, below).</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</strong>: A warpriest cannot cast spells of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;opposed to his own or his deity’s (if he has a deity). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Aura (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A warpriest of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura (as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>) corresponding to the deity’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>).</p>\n<h2>Blessings (Su)</h2>\n<p>A warpriest’s deity influences his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him.

A warpriest can select an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;matches that domain. If a warpriest isn’t devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval.

A warpriest can call upon the power of his blessings a number of times per day (in any combination) equal to 3 + 1/2 his warpriest level (to a maximum of 13 times per day at 20th level). Each time he calls upon any one of his blessings, it counts against his daily limit.

Subject to GM discretion, the warpriest can change his former blessings or domains to make them conform.<br><br>Blessings are here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/warpriest/blessings/\">Blessings.</a></p>\n<h2>Focus Weapon</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a warpriest receives&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat (he can choose any weapon, not just his deity’s favored weapon).</p>\n<h2>Sacred Weapon (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feat; if he has multiple&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feats, this ability applies to all of them. Whenever the warpriest hits with his sacred weapon, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is listed on Table 1–14; see the table below for Small and Large warpriests. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage—this must be declared before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made. (If the weapon’s base damage exceeds the sacred weapon damage, its damage is unchanged.) This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon, and doesn’t apply to alchemical items, bombs, or other weapons that only deal energy damage.</p>\n<p>At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance one of his sacred weapons with divine power as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This power grants the weapon a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the warpriest has more than one sacred weapon, he can enhance another on the following round by using another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. The warpriest can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his warpriest level, but these rounds need not be consecutive.</p>\n<p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance a weapon with any of the following weapon special abilities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/brilliant-energy\">brilliant energy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/defending\">defending</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/disruption\">disruption</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost\">frost</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/keen\">keen</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock\">shock</a>. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/anarchic\">anarchic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vicious\">vicious</a>. If he is evil, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/mighty-cleaving\">mighty cleaving</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>. If he is good, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ghost-touch\">ghost touch</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>. If he is lawful, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/axiomatic\">axiomatic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/merciful\">merciful</a>. If he is neutral (with no other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>), he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/spell-storing\">spell storing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/thundering\">thundering</a>. Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability’s base cost. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The weapon must have at least a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;before any other special abilities can be added.</p>\n<p>If multiple weapons are enhanced, each one consumes rounds of use individually. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;and special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses do not apply if another creature is wielding the weapon, but they continue to be in effect if the weapon otherwise leaves the warpriest’s possession (such as if the weapon is thrown). This ability can be ended as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;at the start of the warpriest’s turn (that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed during the same round). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects apply to only one end of the weapon.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 10px; table-layout: fixed; border-color: #888888; min-width: 200px; color: #333333; font-family: Varela, sans-serif;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #cfe2f3;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Level</th>\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Damage(Small)</th>\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Damage(Large)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1st-4rd</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d4</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">5th-9th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d6</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">10th-14th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d8</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">15th-19th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d10</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">20th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d6</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">3d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A warpriest’s bonus language options include Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>\n<h2>Fervor (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a warpriest can draw upon the power of his faith to heal wounds or harm foes. He can also use this ability to quickly cast spells that aid in his struggles. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his warpriest level + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. By expending one use of this ability, a good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) can touch a creature to heal it of 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 3 warpriest levels he possesses above 2nd (to a maximum of 7d6 at 20th level). Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;(unless the warpriest targets himself, in which case it’s a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>). Alternatively, the warpriest can use this ability to harm an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creature, dealing the same amount of damage he would otherwise heal with a melee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a>. Using fervor in this way is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that provokes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">Undead</a>&nbsp;do not receive a saving throw against this damage. This counts as positive energy.</p>\n<p>An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) can use this ability to instead deal damage to living creatures with a melee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a>&nbsp;and heal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures with a touch. This counts as negative energy.</p>\n<p>A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) uses this ability as a good warpriest if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or as an evil warpriest if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells.</p>\n<p>As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a warpriest can expend one use of this ability to cast any one warpriest spell he has prepared with a casting time of 1 round or shorter. When cast in this way, the spell can target only the warpriest, even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets. Spells cast in this way ignore somatic components and do not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. The warpriest does not need to have a free hand to cast a spell in this way.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feats</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a warpriest gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feats</a>. The warpriest must meet the prerequisites for these feats, but he treats his warpriest level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;(in addition to base attack bonuses gained from other classes and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Dice</a>) for the purpose of qualifying for these feats.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the purposes of these feats, the warpriest can select feats that have a minimum number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;levels as a prerequisite, treating his warpriest level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;level.</p>\n<h2>Channel Energy (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a warpriest can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of his faith through his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>) symbol. This energy can be used to deal or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that expends two uses of his fervor ability and doesn’t provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>. The warpriest must present a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>) symbol to use this ability. A good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to heal living creatures or to deal damage to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or heal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) channels positive energy if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or negative energy if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells.</p>\n<p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the warpriest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to the amount listed in the fervor ability. Creatures that take damage from channeled energy must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saving throw to halve the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 the warpriest’s level + the warpriest’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;is lost. A warpriest can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect.</p>\n<h2>Sacred Armor (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance his armor with divine power as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This power grants the armor a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>. For every 3 levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). The warpriest can use this ability a number of minutes per day equal to his warpriest level. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments, but they don’t need to be consecutive.</p>\n<p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance armor any of the following armor special abilities: energy resistance (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance/\">normal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance-improved/\">improved</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance-greater/\">greater</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/fortification/\">fortification</a>&nbsp;(heavy, light, or moderate),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/glamered\">glamered</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/spell-resistance/\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;(13, 15, 17, and 19). Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability’s base cost. For this purpose, glamered counts as a +1 bonus, energy resistance counts as +2, improved energy resistance counts as +4, and greater energy resistance counts as +5. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;before any other special abilities can be added.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;and armor special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses apply only while the warpriest is wearing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest’s possession. This ability can be ended as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;at the start of the warpriest’s turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield.</p>\n<p>When the warpriest uses this ability, he can also use his sacred weapon ability as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;by expending one use of his fervor.</p>\n<h2>Aspect of War (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the warpriest can channel an aspect of war, growing in power and martial ability. Once per day as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a warpriest can treat his level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>, gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;10/—, and can move at his full speed regardless of the armor he is wearing or his encumbrance. In addition, the blessings he calls upon don’t count against his daily limit during this time.

The swashbuckler chooses a part of the body to target. If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted. If a creature doesn’t have one of the listed body locations, that body part cannot be targeted. Creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack\">sneak attacks</a>&nbsp;are also immune to targeted strikes.

This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>\n<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch’s patron adds new spells to a witch’s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch/witch-patrons#Patron_Themes_and_Spells\">See a complete list of witch patrons here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Witch's Familiar (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard’s</a>&nbsp;arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch/witch-s-familiar\">Witch’s Familiar section</a>.</p>\n<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch’s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st level spells of the witch’s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual.</p>\n<h2>Major Hex</h2>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>\n<ul class=\"ogn-childpages\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

{"_id":"SjFqQceVeVBzBwgn","name":"Cleric","permission":{"default":0,"kxj1AdlhCR0Bl1uR":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies’ prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion—such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge—free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.)</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A cleric’s alignment must be within one step of her deity’s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.)

Clerics are also proficient with the favored weapon of their deities.</p>\n<h2>Aura (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity’s alignment (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>&nbsp;for details).</p>\n<h2>Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>A cleric casts divine spells which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-cleric\">cleric spell list</a>. Her alignment, however, may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A cleric must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Cleric. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</strong>&nbsp;A cleric can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Orisons</h2>\n<p>Clerics can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Cleric&nbsp;under “Spells per day.” These spells are treated like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Channel Energy (Su)</h2>\n<p>Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.</p>\n<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).</p>\n<p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will</a>&nbsp;save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric’s level + the cleric’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.</p>\n<p>A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability.</p>\n<h2>Domains</h2>\n<p>A cleric’s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;(Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities (subject to GM approval). The restriction on alignment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;still applies.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;grants a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>s in that slot. If a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.</p>\n<p>In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, activating a domain power is a standard action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete listing of cleric domains can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">Cleric Domains</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting</h2>\n<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).</p>\n<p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity) can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).</p>\n<p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric channels positive or negative energy (see channel energy).</p>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A cleric’s bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg","effects":[]}

A monk may thus apply his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.</p>\n<p>Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;instead with no penalty on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>.

In addition, he always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>. By spending 1 point from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a monk gains a +20 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>&nbsp;checks made to jump for 1 round.</p>\n<h2>Purity of Body (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-\">immunity</a>&nbsp;to all diseases, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-\">supernatural</a>&nbsp;and magical diseases.</p>\n<h2>Wholeness of Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. He can heal a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;of damage equal to his monk level by using 2 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 9th level, a monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>&nbsp;ability improves. He still takes no damage on a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;monk does not gain the benefit of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Evasion-Ex-\">improved evasion</a>.</p>\n<h2>Diamond Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-\">immunity</a>&nbsp;to poisons of all kinds.</p>\n<h2>Abundant Step (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door\">dimension door</a>. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;that consumes 2 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;for this effect is equal to his monk level. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability.</p>\n<h2>Diamond Soul (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to his current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;check (1d20 +&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>) that equals or exceeds the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>.</p>\n<h2>Quivering Palm (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his intent before making his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>), and unless the target makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;(DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wis</a>&nbsp;modifier), it dies. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is negated.</p>\n<h2>Timeless Body (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>\n<h2>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</p>\n<h2>Empty Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/etherealness\">etherealness</a>. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;that consumes 3 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool. This ability only affects the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures ethereal.</p>\n<h2>Perfect Self</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsider</a>&nbsp;rather than as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoid</a>&nbsp;(or whatever the monk’s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction-DR-\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;10/<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Chaotic\">chaotic</a>, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attack</a>&nbsp;made by a creature that doesn’t have similar&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. Unlike other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsiders</a>, the monk can still be brought back from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;as if he were a member of his previous creature type.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/equipment/gloves.jpg","effects":[]}

These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">Combat Feats</a>, sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bravery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Armor Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus allowed.</p>\n<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Armor Training</strong>: Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor’s check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Fighter/#Advanced-Armor-Training\">Advanced Armor Training</a>&nbsp;below) . If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapon Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th*, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>\n<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from his group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Training</strong>: Beginning at 9th level, instead of selecting an additional fighter weapon group, a fighter can choose an advanced weapon training option (see&nbsp;<a

If he succeeds at the check, he is treated as having properly donned his armor rather than having hastily donned it. The fighter can also remove his armor in the same amount of time that it takes him to don his armor hastily. He can even remove sections of armor to escape grapples and similar grasping hindrances.

Fighting against corruption and the evil that lurks within society makes you a target and, even worse, puts your friends and family in danger. For those who must maintain a social persona, being a part of the greater community while secretly fighting against powerful forces within it requires leading a double life.</p>\n<p>By day, the vigilante maneuvers through society, dealing with other nobles or influential individuals. By night, he dons a disguise and an utterly different set of goals, taking the fight to his foes and solving problems with a blade when words will not suffice.</p>\n<p>Game Masters should consider carefully whether or not a vigilante will make for a good fit with their campaign. The class is one that requires a degree of social aptitude and roleplaying to make full use of its potential.</p>\n<p>Campaigns that focus more on wilderness exploration, travel, or dungeon delving and that are lighter on politics, negotiation, and manipulation might require a vigilante player to put in additional effort to make full use of his class features. Alternatively, a vigilante is uniquely suited to make for a powerful villain, hidden by day behind a mask of civility and a terror at night, free to commit terrible acts without risking discovery.</p>\n<p>For players, the vigilante offers a unique opportunity to take on the role of a character with a hidden side, and whose life is committed to a secret agenda that he must struggle to advance in a complex world. Not every problem can be solved with a dagger in the dark, and even the most stubborn foe might be become an ally with the proper bribe. For the vigilante, these tasks are both within reach as long as you learn to properly use your dual nature and hidden skills to your fullest advantage.</p>\n<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king’s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others.</p>\n<p>Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>\n<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures—the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous

and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>\n<h2>Dual Identity (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante’s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>\n<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante’s secret.</p>\n<p>Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hat-of-disguise\">hat of disguise</a>&nbsp;and similar spells and effects that change the user’s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>\n<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante’s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements.</p>\n<p>A vigilante’s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>.</p>\n<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>\n<h2>Seamless Guise (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>&nbsp;check with a +20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>\n<h2>Social Talent</h2>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Always Prepared (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante can set aside resources to plan for future contingencies. The vigilante gains the Brilliant Planner feat except he can spend up to 100 gp per character level for his brilliant plan fund and only requires 1 minute to enact his brilliant plan. In addition, while in a settlement for at least 1 week, he can spend 24 hours and up to 500 gp per character level to create a stash somewhere within the settlement. Once per day, the vigilante can take 1 hour to retrieve a stash, retrieving any number of items that would have been available in a settlement he visited at the time of making the stash, regardless of the weight of the items. Once he retrieves a stash in this way, he subtracts the price of the items from the stash’s value and the stash is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted\">exhausted</a>&nbsp;and lost, regardless if he used the full value of the stash. The vigilante can maintain any number of stashes, but a stash is lost if he does not spend 1 hour to maintain the stash at least once per month. A vigilante’s stash is well-hidden and only the vigilante knows the location of a stash he creates.&nbsp;Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Qd7Bem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC:CoL</a></p>\n<p><strong>Ancestral Enlightenment (Ex)</strong>:&nbsp;The vigilante can attempt any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;check untrained. If he already has ranks in a particular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill, he gains a +4 bonus on checks with that skill. A vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.&nbsp;Source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BXnNI5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PZO9488</a></p>\n<p><strong>Any Guise (Su)</strong>: A vigilante can use his everyman social talent to disguise himself as any specific person, even a king or high priest. Furthermore, if the actual individual wouldn’t normally be able to be found via magic (such as by being dead or protected from divinations designed to locate the individual), such divinations always find the vigilante instead. A vigilante must be at least 17th level and have the everyman social talent to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Beast Friend (Su)</strong>:&nbsp;The vigilante can cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-animal\">charm animal</a>&nbsp;once per day as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like ability</a>, with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;equal to his level. The vigilante must have the songbird talent to select this talent.&nbsp;Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XWCEyw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC:HoG</a></p>\n<p><strong>Beast Speech (Su)</strong>:&nbsp;The vigilante can cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals\">speak with animals</a>&nbsp;once per day as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like ability</a>, with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;equal to his character level. The vigilante must have the songbird talent to select this talent.&nbsp;Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XWCEyw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC:HoG</a></p>\n<p><strong>Case the Joint (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante can use his social identity to learn important facts about a location before returning later in his vigilante identity. If he spends at least 1 hour in a location while in his social identity, he can attempt a DC 20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(engineering) check. If he succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check involving the location’s layout (such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a>&nbsp;check to sneak into the location, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;check to disable an alarm, or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sleight-of-hand\">Sleight of Hand</a>&nbsp;check to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the vigilante gains an additional reroll. If the vigilante fails to return to the location within 1 week, the situation changes too much and he cannot use the rerolls. A vigilante can’t case the same joint more than once a week.</p>\n<p><strong>Celebrity Discount (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante’s social identity is popular enough to receive discounts in his area of renown. Whenever he buys an item in his area of renown that costs 500 gp or less, he can buy it at 90% of the market price, rather than the full price. If he has the great renown social talent, the gp limit increases to 2,000 gp, and if he possesses the incredible renown social talent, the gp limit increases to 8,000 gp. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Celebrity Perks (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante is a celebrity in his area of renown, and adoring fans are all too eager to shower him with the fundamental necessities. While within his area of renown, he can always receive common meals or lodging (worth up to 1 gp per meal or night) for free, and can avoid paying taxes or bribes of 1 gp or less. If he wants a particular non-magical item worth 1 gp or less, he can spend 1d10 minutes interacting with people in his area of renown to receive the item from a fan (if he ever sells such a gift from a fan, he loses this social talent permanently). If he has the great renown social talent, he can receive gifts of up to 5 gp, receive fine food and lodgings (worth up to 10 gp per meal or night) for free, and avoid paying taxes or bribes of 10 gp or less. If he has incredible renown, he can receive gifts of up to 25 gp, receive exquisite food and lodgings (worth up to 100 gp per meal or night) for free, and avoid paying taxes or bribes of 100 gp or less. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Double Time (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante’s social identity is that of a skilled and respected artisan or professional, rather than a merchant or noble. In order to complete his day’s work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a>&nbsp;skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he’s chosen with social grace. A vigilante must have a social identity appropriate to the chosen skill to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Entrepreneur (Ex)</strong>: Select any one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>-,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>-, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>-based skill other than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device\">Use Magic Device</a>. The vigilante can use the selected skill to earn money as if he were using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a>&nbsp;skill. If he selects&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a>, the vigilante instead gains the skill unlock powers for those skills as appropriate for his number of ranks in that skill. If he has the social grace social talent, he can apply this benefit to all skills selected with the social grace talent.&nbsp;Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601258445/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1601258445&amp;linkId=6ed72bcd2ace3e794050b798e0c8346e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PPC:SpyHB</a></p>\n<p><strong>Everyman (Su)</strong>: The vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise using his many guises social talent. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>&nbsp;checks to appear as that individual. Any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50% chance of finding the vigilante instead of the actual individual, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Divination\">divination</a>&nbsp;spells and abilities used on the vigilante give results as if he were the actual individual. Although this doesn’t grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante’s training grants him a +10&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff\">Bluff</a>&nbsp;checks to properly play the part of the individual. A vigilante must be at least 11th level and have the many guises social talent to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Feign Innocence (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante’s social identity seems so innocent that it is hard to believe he was involved in wrongdoing. Within his area of renown, this provides a non-magical effect identical to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/innocence\">innocence</a>&nbsp;spell. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to take this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Gossip Collector (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante sits at the center of a web of gossip, granting him access to the latest scuttlebutt with baffling speed. Whenever the vigilante is presented with a topic about which he would normally need to spend 1d4 hours to gather information, he must spend only 1d2 hours instead. If he has the renown social talent and gathers the information in his area of renown, he must instead spend only 1d4 × 10 minutes, and if he beats the DC to gather a piece of information by 20 or more, he knows that piece of information without spending any time at all; he has simply already heard that gossip. This ability doesn’t allow him to gather information that isn’t available in the locale he is canvassing, even if that locale is his area of renown.</p>\n<p><a name=\"great-renown\"></a><strong>Great Renown (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante is known on a broader scale. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;checks from his renown social talent while he is in his vigilante identity increases to +6.

Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this talent gains a bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;checks to gather information equal to half his vigilante level. In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;checks to gather information about the vigilante and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks to track him by an amount equal to his level. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week. Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Many Guises (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>&nbsp;checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hat-of-disguise\">hat of disguise</a>), <strong>his</strong> mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion). A vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Mockingbird (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance. This functions similarly to a combination of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/ghost-sound\">ghost sound</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/ventriloquism\">ventriloquism</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/vocal-alteration\">vocal alteration</a>&nbsp;spells. A vigilante must be at least 5th level to choose this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Morphic Mask (Su)</strong>: The vigilante’s physical form in his vigilante identity can differ significantly from that of his social identity, within the norms for his race—this can include changes to the vigilante’s proportions, coloration, gender characteristics, and other physical characteristics. This increases the vigilante’s bonus from seamless guise by 2 for every significant change, as per the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>&nbsp;skill.

Instead of needing 1 minute to change his identity, he can now do so as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>. If, after a quick change, he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must attempt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>&nbsp;check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that the identities are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 additional round adjusting and perfecting his appearance and persona to negate the need for this check. A vigilante must be at least 7th level to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Renown (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies. While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village, if using settlement population ranges). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person’s initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;skill description). While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within a number of miles equal to his vigilante level. A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that’s one category worse, rather than one category better.</p>\n<p><strong>Safe House (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante can establish a safe house in his area of renown, and he can change it every time he changes his area of renown. If he doesn’t have the renown talent, he can still select this talent and place the safe house in a single location to which he has access, but he can never move the safe house from its initial location until he gains the renown talent. This safe house must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is a number of feet per side equal to 10 feet per vigilante level. The safe house can be arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house can’t be located by any effect that is less powerful than a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-location\">discern location</a>&nbsp;spell. At 7th level, this protection from being located also applies to creatures in the safe house. At 13th level, the entire area is protected from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scrying\">scrying</a>&nbsp;effects (though not mundane snooping) like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mage-s-private-sanctum\">mage’s private sanctum</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Familiarity (Ex)</strong>:&nbsp;The vigilante chooses four skills when he gains this talent. He can take 10 on checks with his chosen skills even when distracted or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares\">threatened</a>. If he takes 10 on checks with these skills while not distracted or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares\">threatened</a>, he gains a bonus on the check equal to one-quarter his vigilante level (minimum +2).

Whenever the vigilante is in his social identity, he receives a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on checks with the selected skill. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he can select another skill (with the same restrictions) to gain this bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Songbird (Su)</strong>:&nbsp;The vigilante gains the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animal-messenger\">animal messenger</a>&nbsp;once per day as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like ability</a>, with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;equal to his character level. He also gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal\">Handle Animal</a>&nbsp;as a class skill.&nbsp;Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XWCEyw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC:HoG</a></p>\n<p><strong>Subjective Truth (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante’s disparate identities allow him to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what he says is true from the point of view of his current identity, it detects as true to effects such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-lies\">discern lies</a>, and he can say it in effects such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/z/zone-of-truth\">zone of truth</a>&nbsp;that force him to speak the truth. A vigilante must be at least 9th level and have the feign innocence social talent to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Triumphant Return (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante’s tales are never truly forgotten. This makes it easier to establish his renown in a place he has established it before. In any settlement where the vigilante previously gained renown, it takes only 3 days, rather than 1 week, to gain renown again. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Well-Known Expert (Ex)</strong>: The vigilante’s social identity is known as an expert in numerous fields, including areas and topics the vigilante hasn’t actually taken the time to study. As a result the vigilante is skilled at encouraging others to discover solutions to difficult problems themselves by asking probing questions, while appearing to give the information himself. In his social identity, the vigilante can take 10 when attempting to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Aid-Another\">aid another</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/appraise\">Appraise</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;checks. He also gains a bonus equal to half his class level (minimum +1) on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff\">Bluff</a>&nbsp;checks to appear knowledgeable in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/appraise\">Appraise</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(all), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(all). If he has the renown social talent, he grants a +3 bonus when he successfully aids another on these skill checks, rather than +2. In his area of renown, the vigilante’s social identity is so trusted as an expert that scholars are inspired to make amazing deductions and intuitive leaps in discussions with him. A creature that has already failed a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;check on a specific subject can attempt one additional check to gain information on the same topic if it receives an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Aid-Another\">aid another</a>&nbsp;bonus from the vigilante when doing so.</p>\n<h2>Vigilante Specialization (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>\n<p>An avenger gains a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table: The Vigilante. He adds this value to any other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;gained from other classes or racial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Dice</a>&nbsp;as normal.</p>\n<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>&nbsp;by startling appearance. This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking\">flanking</a>&nbsp;or that is denied its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment\">concealment</a>&nbsp;(but not total&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment\">concealment</a>).</p>\n<p>Once this choice is made, it can’t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante’s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<h2>Vigilante Talent</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can’t be changed.</p>\n<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>&nbsp;check against the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;checks of all onlookers (without the +20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante’s level + the vigilante’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Animal Patron (Ex)</strong>:&nbsp;The vigilante gains the benefits of one minor shifter aspect for a number of minutes per day equal to 1 + half his vigilante level. He can shift into this minor aspect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>.

The vigilante counts as having received aid and automatically succeeds at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;check to become conscious after 1 hour (unless he has actually died in the meantime).</p>\n<p><strong>Aquatic Action (Ex)</strong>:&nbsp;The vigilante uses weapons,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapons</a>, and unarmed strikes in aquatic environments as though under the effect of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/freedom-of-movement\">freedom of movement</a>, including when making melee attacks against targets in the water while the vigilante is on land. The vigilante ignores limitations and penalties on ranged attacks, including thrown weapons, imposed by being underwater for the first 15 feet. (See Underwater Combat for more information.)

He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 his vigilante level (minimum four times per day). The vigilante can use this ability again before the duration expires to replace a previous racial feat with another choice. If a feat temporarily gained in this way has a daily use limitation, any uses of that feat while using this ability count toward that feat’s daily limit. This vigilante talent can be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected after the first, the vigilante can use this ability to gain the benefits of one additional racial feat at the same time, or to reduce the action required to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Activate-Magic-Item\">activate</a>&nbsp;this talent by one step (a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;becomes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;becomes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;becomes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>). If the vigilante chooses to gain the benefits of multiple feats, the feats selected must share the same racial prerequisite. He can use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of a second feat; doing so means he cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another’s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it.

He treats his vigilante level as his vigilante&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of meeting prerequisites of feats and abilities that have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/whip-mastery-combat\">Whip Mastery</a>&nbsp;as a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>Unshakable (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;him.</p>\n<h2>Startling Appearance (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante’s presence (usually due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility\">invisibility</a>), the foe is treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>&nbsp;for the rest of the vigilante’s turn (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>).</p>\n<p>The foe also takes a –4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante’s next turn.</p>\n<h2>Frightening Appearance (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante’s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, attempt an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante’s attack, that foe is also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened\">frightened</a>&nbsp;for 1 round, in addition to being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken\">shaken</a>&nbsp;as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante’s class level + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier).</p>\n<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante’s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear\">fear</a>&nbsp;effect.</p>\n<h2>Stunning Appearance (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante’s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante’s class level + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier) or be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>&nbsp;until the end of the vigilante’s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante’s class level, it receives a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on this save.</p>\n<p>This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante’s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear\">fear</a>&nbsp;effect.</p>\n<h2>Vengeance Strike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante’s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>&nbsp;(to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares\">threatened</a>&nbsp;by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_07.jpg","effects":[]}

She gains another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">rage power</a>&nbsp;for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">rage powers</a>&nbsp;only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>\n<p>Any barbarian who meets the powers’ prerequisites can select and use rage powers. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with “dragon totem” in its title).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of rage powers can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">Rage Powers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so.

These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in place of a bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;for the level.</p>\n<h2>Brawler's Flurry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler’s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;weapon group, or weapons with the “<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>” special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>\n<p>A brawler applies her full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler’s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm\">disarm</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip\">trip</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuvers</a>&nbsp;for unarmed attacks as part of brawler’s flurry. A brawler with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapons</a>&nbsp;can’t use such weapons as part of brawler’s flurry, nor can she make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapon</a>&nbsp;attacks in addition to her brawler’s flurry attacks.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when using brawler’s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/greater-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when using brawler’s flurry.</p>\n<h2>Maneuver Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;checks when performing that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;and a +1 bonus to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>&nbsp;when defending against that maneuver.</p>\n<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>, gaining the above +1 bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;checks and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Maneuver-Training-Ex-\">maneuver training</a>&nbsp;increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;at 3rd level and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;at 7th level, her bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;are +2 and bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;are +1. If she then chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>&nbsp;upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;are +3, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;are +2, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>&nbsp;are +1.)</p>\n<h2>AC Bonus (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, she gains a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p>These bonuses to AC apply against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>, wearing medium or heavy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>\n<h2>Knockout (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>. She must announce this intent before making her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler’s level + the higher of the brawler’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier) or fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>&nbsp;that does not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>\n<h2>Brawler's Strike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a brawler’s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold\">cold iron</a>&nbsp;and silver for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 12th level, she chooses one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. (This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;component cannot be the opposite of the brawler’s actual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a>&nbsp;weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;and bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a>.</p>\n<h2>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a brawler’s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/dagger\">dagger</a>&nbsp;deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon’s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of her adjusted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;damage—this must be declared before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made.</p>\n<h2>Awesome Blow (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, the brawler can as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;perform an awesome blow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler’s choice, and it falls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can’t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/awesome-blow\">Awesome Blow</a>&nbsp;monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>\n<h2>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_11.jpg","effects":[]}

href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/shaman\">shaman spell list</a>. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the shaman’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Shaman. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score.</p>\n<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>\n<h2>Orisons</h2>\n<p>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on&nbsp;Table: Shaman. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Spirit (Su)</h2>\n<p>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit, which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch#TOC-Hex\">hexes</a>&nbsp;possessed by that spirit to the list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch#TOC-Hex\">hexes</a>&nbsp;that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>\n<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">oracle</a>), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>\n<h2>Spirit Animal (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch’s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman’s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, a shaman’s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal’s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>\n<p><a name=\"TOC-Deliver-Touch-Spells-Su-\"></a><strong>Deliver Touch Spells (Su)</strong>: If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;spell, she can designate her animal as the “toucher.” The spirit animal can then deliver the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn’t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>\n<h2>Spirit Magic</h2>\n<p>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feat</a>&nbsp;that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">Metamagic Feats</a>).</p>\n<h2>Hex</h2>\n<p>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>\n<p>Using a hex is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that doesn’t provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>&nbsp;unless otherwise noted.

She uses her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier in place of her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier for the hex. She cannot select major hexes or grand hexes using this ability.

She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>\n<h2>Wandering Hex</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>\n<h2>Manifestation (Su)</h2>\n<p>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit.

Confirming a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>&nbsp;on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Dice</a>&nbsp;than half the gunslinger’s character level does not restore grit.</p>\n<p><strong>Killing Blow with a Firearm</strong>: When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;or unaware creature to 0 or fewer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>, or reducing a creature that has fewer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Dice</a>&nbsp;than half the gunslinger’s character level to 0 or fewer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;does not restore any grit.</p>\n<h2>Deeds</h2>\n<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Deadeye (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm’s first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the –2 penalty on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.</p>\n<p><strong>Gunslinger’s Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Clear (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the gunslinger can remove the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a>&nbsp;condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gunslinger Initiative (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks. Furthermore, if she has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/quick-draw-combat\">Quick Draw</a>&nbsp;feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;check.</p>\n<p><strong>Pistol-Whip (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger’s size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/×2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check to knock the target&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.</p>\n<p><strong>Utility Shot (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blast Lock</strong>: The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">Arcane lock</a>&nbsp;grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/k/knock\">knock</a>&nbsp;can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">arcane lock</a>&nbsp;can still bypass the wards of that spell.</li>\n<li><strong>Scoot Unattended Object</strong>: The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot’s origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.</li>\n<li><strong>Stop Bleeding</strong>: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dead Shot (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;as she can, based on her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>. She makes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;hit the target, the gunslinger’s single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming\">flaming</a>) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;–5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.</p>\n<p><strong>Startling Shot (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>&nbsp;until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeting (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack\">sneak attacks</a>&nbsp;are immune to these effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arms</strong>: On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger’s choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.</li>\n<li><strong>Head</strong>: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused\">confused</a>&nbsp;for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Legs</strong>: On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip\">trip</a>&nbsp;attacks are immune to this effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Torso</strong>: Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19–20.</li>\n<li><strong>Wings</strong>: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly\">Fly</a>&nbsp;check or fall 20 ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bleeding Wound (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;to have that attack deal extra&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage. The amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage is equal to the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage (gunslinger’s choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack\">sneak attacks</a>&nbsp;are also immune to these types of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Expert Loading (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, whenever the gunslinger rolls a misfire with a gun that has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a>&nbsp;condition, she can spend 1 grit point to keep the gun from exploding, though it retains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a>&nbsp;condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Lightning Reload (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;once per round. If she has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/rapid-reload-combat\">Rapid Reload</a>&nbsp;feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Evasive (Ex)</strong>: At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">improved uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogue</a>&nbsp;class features. She uses her gunslinger level as her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogue</a>&nbsp;level for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">improved uncanny dodge</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Menacing Shot (Ex)</strong>: At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst as if they were subject to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear\">fear</a>&nbsp;spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Slinger’s Luck (Ex)</strong>: At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed’s cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Cheat Death (Ex)</strong>: At 19th level, whenever the gunslinger is reduced to 0 or fewer <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>, she can spend all of her remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.</p>\n<p><strong>Death’s Shot (Ex)</strong>: At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>, she can spend 1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>&nbsp;or making a killing blow.</p>\n<p><strong>Stunning Shot (Ex)</strong>: At 19th level, when a gunslinger hits a creature, she can spend 2 grit points to <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stun</a>&nbsp;the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw (the DC = 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier). If the creature fails, it is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>&nbsp;for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect.</p>\n<h2>Deeds of Renown</h2>\n<p>Swashbucklers and gunslingers perform impressive deeds through their grit and panache, but some are capable of truly spectacular acts known as renowned deeds. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/swashbuckler\">swashbuckler</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger</a>&nbsp;(though not members of other classes) can select a renowned deed for her class upon reaching the class level listed in the deed’s description. This replaces the specific listed deed or deeds; if the character would not gain the appropriate deeds, she cannot select the renowned deed, as if selecting an archetype.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Thundering Shot (Ex)</strong>: The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger’s</a>&nbsp;shots explode with deafening reports. At 1st level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger</a>&nbsp;can spend 1 point of grit and make a single ranged attack with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms\">firearm</a>. All creatures in a 15-foot cone, starting at the corner of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger’s</a>&nbsp;square closest to the target and extending directly toward the target, must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save (DC = 10 + half the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger’s</a>&nbsp;class level + the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier) or be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened\">deafened</a>&nbsp;for 1 minute.

At 7th level, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger</a>&nbsp;can spend 1 grit point when she readies an action to make a ranged attack with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms\">firearm</a>&nbsp;against a creature that declares a melee attack against her. If she does, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Ready\">readied</a>&nbsp;ranged attack does not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. If this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Ready\">readied</a>&nbsp;attack hits, she gains a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC against the triggering attack, and she can make a single melee attack with a slashing or piercing weapon against the creature that attacked her; if this melee attack hits, it is considered to be a critical threat. This deed replaces the dead shot deed and one other 7th-level deed.</p>\n<p><strong>Lethal Patience (Ex)</strong>: While wild flurries of bullets are certainly effective at felling foes, veteran gunslingers appreciate the value of lining up the perfect shot. At 15th level, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger</a>&nbsp;can spend 1 grit point to line up a shot against a target as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>. On her next turn, she can make an attack against the target as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, and if the attack hits, the attack is treated as a critical threat. This deed replaces the slinger’s luck deed and one other 15th-level deed.</p>\n<h2>Nimble (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feats</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>\n<h2>Gun Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>\n<h2>True Grit (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform.

Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against evil.

In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline. As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Paladins serve as beacons for their allies within the chaos of battle.

href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#TOC-simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons\">martial</a>&nbsp;weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>\n<h2>Aura of Good (Ex)</h2>\n<p>The power of a paladin’s aura of good (see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-good\">detect good</a>&nbsp;spell) is equal to her paladin level.</p>\n<h2>Detect Evil (Sp)</h2>\n<p>At will, a paladin can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>, as the spell. A paladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the paladin does not detect evil in any other object or individual within range.</p>\n<h2>Smite Evil (Su)</h2>\n<p>Once per day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the paladin adds her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Cha</a>&nbsp;bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the paladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-damage-reduction\">DR</a>&nbsp;the creature might possess.</p>\n<p>In addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a deflection bonus equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (if any) to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>\n<p>The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: Paladin, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>\n<h2>Divine Grace (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;bonus (if any) on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">Saving Throws</a>.</p>\n<h2>Lay On Hands (Su)</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a paladin only needs one free hand to use this ability.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn’t provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-attacks-of-opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>. Undead do not receive a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against this damage.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Courage (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;against fear effects. This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;or dead.</p>\n<h2>Divine Health (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/curses/mummy-rot\">mummy rot</a>.</p>\n<h2>Mercy (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a paladin can select one mercy. Each mercy adds an effect to the paladin’s lay on hands ability. Whenever the paladin uses lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by the paladin. A mercy can remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison without curing the affliction. Such conditions return after 1 hour unless the mercy actually removes the affliction that causes the condition.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, the paladin can select from the following initial mercies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deceived: The target can immediately attempt a new saving throw to disbelieve any ongoing illusions that it failed to disbelieve within the last minute.&nbsp;Source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2lv4Aso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC:HH</a></li>\n<li>Fatigued: The target is no longer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>.</li>\n<li>Riled: The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladin’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin#TOC-Lay-On-Hands-Su-\">lay on hands</a>&nbsp;also acts as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/calm-emotions\">calm emotions</a>, but only for the purpose of suppressing morale bonuses (such as from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/rage\">rage</a>&nbsp;spell) and emotion effects that aren’t fear effects.

This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>-based ability.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-paladin\">paladin spell list</a>. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against a paladin’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>). When&nbsp;Table: Paladin&nbsp;indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score for that spell level.</p>\n<p>A paladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain her daily allotment of spells. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-paladin\">paladin spell list</a>, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n<p>Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is equal to her paladin level – 3.</p>\n<h2>Divine Bond (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a divine bond with her god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>The first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Axiomatic\">axiomatic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Brilliant-Energy\">brilliant energy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Defending\">defending</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/disruption/\">disruption</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming-Burst\">flaming burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Holy\">holy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen\">keen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Merciful\">merciful</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Speed\">speed</a>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s cost (see&nbsp;Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the paladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>\n<p>If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>\n<p>The second type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy horse (for a Medium paladin) or a pony (for a Small paladin), although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also suitable. This mount functions as a druid’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>, using the paladin’s level as her effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;of at least 6.</p>\n<p>In addition to horses, a paladin may select (at the GM’s discretion) some less ordinary creatures.</p>\n<p>A Medium paladin can select an elk, giant seahorse, giraffe, yak0&nbsp;or zebra&nbsp;as a bonded mount.</p>\n<p>A Small paladin can select an antelope, capybara, eohippus, giant weasel, ram, reindeer, stag, or wolfdog&nbsp;as a bonded mount.</p>\n<p>The auspice, bodyguard, racer, and totem guide archetypes are all particularly appropriate for a paladin’s bonded mount.</p>\n<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin’s level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, the mount gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/celestial-creature-cr-special\">celestial creature simple template</a>&nbsp;and becomes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast\">magical beast</a>&nbsp;for the purposes of determining which spells affect it.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, a paladin’s mount gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to the paladin’s level + 11.</p>\n<p>Should the paladin’s mount die, the paladin may not summon another mount for 30 days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Resolve (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, a paladin is immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;against charm effects.</p>\n<p>This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;or dead.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Justice (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, a paladin can expend two uses of her smite evil ability to grant the ability to smite evil to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses. Allies must use this smite evil ability by the start of the paladin’s next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Faith (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, a paladin’s weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">Damage Reduction</a>. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of her is treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">Damage Reduction</a>.</p>\n<p>This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;or dead.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Righteousness (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, a paladin gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">DR</a>&nbsp;5/evil and immunity to compulsion spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;against compulsion effects.</p>\n<p>This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;or dead.</p>\n<h2>Holy Champion (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-damage-reduction\">DR</a>&nbsp;increases to 10/evil. Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes an evil outsider, the outsider is also subject to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/banishment\">banishment</a>, using her paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/banishment\">banishment</a>&nbsp;effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","effects":[]}

In addition, an investigator can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) to identify&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potions</a>&nbsp;as if using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic\">detect magic</a>.

These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>&nbsp;form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a>&nbsp;and similar effects, using the investigator’s level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>.</p>\n<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on&nbsp;Table: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score, in the same way a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;receives bonus spells per day.</p>\n<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator’s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping—an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>\n<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant—comparable to the valueless material&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>&nbsp;of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>\n<p>An investigator uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist\">alchemist</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/formulae-lists-alchemist\">formulae list</a>&nbsp;to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formulae he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score equal to 10 + the extract’s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator’s extract is equal to 10 + the extract’s level + the investigator’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/books-paper-writing-supplies#TOC-Spellbook\">spellbook</a>. An investigator can study a wizard’s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator’s or an alchemist’s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration (Ex)</h2>\n<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled—he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these flashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>\n<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1). An investigator’s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night’s sleep. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/linguistics\">Linguistics</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft\">Spellcraft</a>&nbsp;skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he’s trained in the skill.</p>\n<p>Inspiration can also be used on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator’s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>&nbsp;rather than a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>.</p>\n<h2>Trapfinding</h2>\n<p>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;skill checks made to locate traps and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;to disarm magical traps.</p>\n<h2>Poison Lore (Ex)</h2>\n<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;himself when applying&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>, he can attempt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(nature) check to identify any natural&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(arcana) check to identify any magical&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;(DC = the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison’s</a>&nbsp;saving throw DC). Lastly, once a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) check (DC = the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison’s</a>&nbsp;saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>.</p>\n<h2>Poison Resistance (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>.</p>\n<h2>Investigator Talent (Ex) or (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>\n<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator’s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt..</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete listing of investigator talents can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/investigator-talents#TABLE-Investigator-Talents\">Investigator Talents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Keen Recollection</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill checks untrained.</p>\n<h2>Trap Sense (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;saving throws to avoid traps and a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>\n<h2>Studied Combat (Ex)</h2>\n<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;on melee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>.</p>\n<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator’s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator’s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;to use this ability.</p>\n<h2>Studied Strike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>; creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack\">sneak attacks</a>&nbsp;are also immune to studied strike.</p>\n<p>If the investigator’s attack used a weapon that deals&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;(like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/sap\">sap</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/whip\">whip</a>, or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;(with the usual –4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>.</p>\n<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment\">concealment</a>.</p>\n<h2>Swift Alchemy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.</p>\n<h2>True Inspiration (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks—even ones he isn’t trained in—and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/pipe.jpg","effects":[]}

The cavalier’s melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the cavalier’s level. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>\n<p>Challenging a foe requires much of the cavalier’s concentration.

Should a cavalier’s mount die, the cavalier may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the cavalier gains a level.</p>\n<h2>Order (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order’s challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation. A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM’s preference.</p>\n<p>The following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Cavalier/#orders\">orders</a>&nbsp;can be chosen by both cavaliers and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/samurai\">samurai</a>.</p>\n<p>Members of these orders are not necessarily bound together, but some organizations do exist that are comprised of cavaliers that all belong to one specific order.</p>\n<h2>Tactician (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a cavalier receives a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the cavalier can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two levels the cavalier possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Cavalier's Charge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to make more accurate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge\">charge</a>&nbsp;attacks while mounted. The cavalier receives a +4 bonus on melee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge\">charge</a>&nbsp;while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier does not suffer any penalty to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;after making a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge\">charge</a>&nbsp;attack while mounted.</p>\n<h2>Expert Trainer (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a cavalier learns to train mounts with speed and unsurpassed expertise. The cavalier receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his cavalier level whenever he uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal\">Handle Animal</a>&nbsp;on an animal that serves as a mount. In addition, he can reduce the time needed to teach a mount a new trick or train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week required by increasing the DC by +5. He can also train more than one mount at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the DC.</p>\n<h2>Banner (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a cavalier’s banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier’s banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear\">fear</a>&nbsp;and a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;made as part of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge\">charge</a>. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feat</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, and at every six levels thereafter, a cavalier gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement.

Double the threat range of any weapons wielded during a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge\">charge</a>&nbsp;while mounted.

In addition, the cavalier can make a free&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm\">disarm</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip\">trip</a>&nbsp;combat maneuver if his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge\">charge</a>&nbsp;attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>.</p>\n<h2>Demanding Challenge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level, whenever a cavalier declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a –2 penalty to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;from attacks made by anyone other than the cavalier.</p>\n<h2>Greater Banner (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the cavalier’s banner becomes a rallying call to his allies.

In addition, while his banner is displayed, the cavalier can spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once per day.</p>\n<h2>Master Tactician (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, the cavalier receives an additional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Whenever the cavalier uses the tactician ability, he grants any two teamwork feats that he knows. He can select from any of his teamwork feats, not just his bonus feats.</p>\n<h2>Supreme Charge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge\">charge</a>&nbsp;attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Damage\">damage</a>&nbsp;(or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge\">charge</a>&nbsp;attack while mounted, the target is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>&nbsp;for 1d4 rounds. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;save reduces this to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered\">staggered</a>&nbsp;for 1d4 rounds.

Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It’s said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>\n<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society.

An antipaladin can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>, concentrate on a single Item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">strength</a>&nbsp;of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-good\">detect good</a>&nbsp;in any other object or individual within range.</p>\n<h2>Smite Good (Su)</h2>\n<p>Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good\">good</a>, the antipaladin adds his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite.

Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">DR</a>&nbsp;the creature might possess.</p>\n<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (if any) to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>\n<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Antipaladin, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>\n<h2>Unholy Resilience (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;bonus (if any) on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>.</p>\n<h2>Touch of Corruption (Su)</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a>, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses.

This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladin</a>&nbsp;class feature. For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/extra-lay-on-hands\">Extra Lay On Hands</a>&nbsp;feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Cowardice (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a –4 penalty on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;against fear effects.

An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>\n<h2>Cruelty (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin’s touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin.

The antipaladin must have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigue</a>&nbsp;cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</p>\n<p><strong>Frightened</strong>: The target is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened\">frightened</a>&nbsp;for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken\">shaken</a>&nbsp;cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</p>\n<p><strong>Nauseated</strong>: The target is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated\">nauseated</a>&nbsp;for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened\">sickened</a>&nbsp;cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</p>\n<p><strong>Poisoned</strong>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/poison\">poison</a>, using the antipaladin’s level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Blinded</strong>: The target is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded\">blinded</a>&nbsp;for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</p>\n<p><strong>Deafened</strong>: The target is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened\">deafened</a>&nbsp;for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</p>\n<p><strong>Paralyzed</strong>: The target is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>&nbsp;for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Stunned</strong>: The target is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>&nbsp;for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin.</p>\n</div>\n<p>These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin’s touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed\">dazed</a>, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can’t be changed.</p>\n<h2>Channel Negative Energy (Su)</h2>\n<p>When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-\">supernatural</a>&nbsp;ability to channel negative energy like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;level when channeling negative energy. This is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>-based ability.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/antipaladin-spell-list\">antipaladin spell list</a>. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an antipaladin’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladin</a>&nbsp;and is given on&nbsp;Table: Antipaladin. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score. When&nbsp;Table: Antipaladin&nbsp;indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score for that spell level.</p>\n<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>\n<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. At 4th level and higher, his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;is equal to his antipaladin level –3.</p>\n<h2>Fiendish Boon (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Unholy\">unholy</a>&nbsp;light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level.</p>\n<p>Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s cost (sorted and listed below).</p>\n<p>These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties:</p>\n<div>\n<p>+1:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming/\" rel=\"nofollow\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/keen/\">keen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vicious/\">vicious</a></p>\n<p>+2:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/anarchic/\">anarchic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming-burst/\">flaming burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy/\">unholy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/wounding/\">wounding</a></p>\n<p>+3:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed/\">speed</a></p>\n<p>+5:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vorpal/\">vorpal</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>\n<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>\n<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster III</a>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Chaotic\">chaotic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil\">evil</a>&nbsp;subtypes or it must be a fiendish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster</a>&nbsp;spell increases by one, to a maximum of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster\">summon monster IX</a>&nbsp;at 17th level. Once per day, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin’s level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/advanced-creature-cr-1\">advanced template</a>. At 15th level, an antipaladin’s servant gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to the antipaladin’s level + 11.</p>\n<p>Should the antipaladin’s fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Despair (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a –2 penalty on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>\n<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Vengeance (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good\">good</a>&nbsp;ability to grant the ability to smite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good\">good</a>&nbsp;to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good\">good</a>&nbsp;ability by the start of the antipaladin’s next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good\">Good</a>&nbsp;creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Sin (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, an antipaladin’s weapons are treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil\">evil</a>-aligned for the purposes of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil\">evil</a>-aligned for the purposes of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>.

Each enemy within 10 feet takes a –4 penalty on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>.</p>\n<h2>Unholy Champion (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">DR</a>&nbsp;increases to 10/<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good\">good</a>. Whenever he uses smite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good\">good</a>&nbsp;and successfully strikes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good\">good</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsider</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsider</a>&nbsp;is also subject to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/banishment\">banishment</a>, using his antipaladin level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;(his weapon and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Unholy\">unholy</a>&nbsp;symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates).

Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game—even fugitives among their own people.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Ranger are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle.

He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<h2>Endurance</h2>\n<p>A ranger gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/endurance\">Endurance</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>\n<h2>Favored Terrain (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from&nbsp;Table: Ranger Favored Terrains.

In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;bonus in any one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-\">favored terrain</a>&nbsp;(including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>\n<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-\">favored terrain</a>, the ranger’s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<h2>Hunter's Bond (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;to grant half his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A ranger who selects an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;can choose from the following list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Badger\">badger</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Bird\">bird</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-camel\">camel</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Cat-Small\">cat (small)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Rat-Dire\">dire rat</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Dog\">dog</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Horse\">horse</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Pony\">pony</a>, snake (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Viper\">viper</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Constrictor\">constrictor</a>), or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Wolf\">wolf</a>. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose a shark instead.

He takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>\n<h2>Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.

He can now select a quarry as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, and can now take 20 while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>\n<h2>Master Hunter (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to follow tracks without penalty.

If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save or die.

Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/dancing\">dancing</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming-burst\">flaming burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost\">frost</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/icy-burst\">icy burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/keen\">keen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock\">shock</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shocking-burst\">shocking burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed\">speed</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vorpal\">vorpal</a>.</p>\n<p>Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.</p>\n<p>A magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.</p>\n<h2>Spell Combat (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a magus learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time. This functions much like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat\">two-weapon fighting</a>, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, the magus must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a –2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Casting-Time\">casting time</a>&nbsp;of 1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;(any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If he casts this spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>, up to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;bonus, and add the same amount as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. A magus can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if he has more than one attack, he cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.</p>\n<h2>Spellstrike (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, whenever a magus casts a spell with a range of “touch” from the magus spell list, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a>&nbsp;normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the magus makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon’s critical range (20, 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen\">keen</a>&nbsp;weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals ×2 damage on a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.</p>\n<h2>Magus Arcana</h2>\n<p>As he gains levels, a magus learns arcane secrets tailored to his specific way of blending martial puissance and magical skill. Starting at 3rd level, a magus gains one magus arcana. He gains an additional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">magus arcana</a>&nbsp;for every three levels of magus attained after 3rd level. Unless specifically noted in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">magus arcana’s</a>&nbsp;description, a magus cannot select a particular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">magus arcana</a>&nbsp;more than once.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">Magus arcana</a>&nbsp;that affect spells can only be used to modify spells from the magus spell list unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of magus arcana can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">Magus Arcana</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spell Recall (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells he has already cast. With a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;he can recall any single magus spell that he has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell’s level (minimum 1). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feats</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, and every six levels thereafter, a magus gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">item creation</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>. He must meet the prerequisites for these feats as normal.</p>\n<h2>Knowledge Pool (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, when a magus prepares his magus spells, he can decide to expend 1 or more points from his arcane pool, up to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;bonus. For each point he expends, he can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in his spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If he does not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time he prepares spells, he loses those spells. He can also cast spells added in this way using his spell recall ability, but only until he prepares spells again.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, a magus gains proficiency with medium armor. A magus can cast magus spells while wearing medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.</p>\n<h2>Improved Spell Combat (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, the magus’s ability to cast spells and make melee attacks improves. When using the spell combat ability, the magus receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;checks, in addition to any bonus granted by taking an additional penalty on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, a magus counts 1/2 his total magus level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;level for the purpose of qualifying for feats. If he has levels in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>, these levels stack.</p>\n<h2>Improved Spell Recall (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, the magus’s ability to recall spells using his arcane pool becomes more efficient. Whenever he recalls a spell with spell recall, he expends a number of points from his arcane pool equal to 1/2 the spell’s level (minimum 1). Furthermore, instead of recalling a used spell, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;the magus can prepare a spell of the same level that he has in his spellbook. He does so by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell’s level (minimum 1). The magus cannot apply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>&nbsp;to a spell prepared in this way. The magus does not need to reference his spellbook to prepare a spell in this way.</p>\n<h2>Heavy Armor (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, a magus gains proficiency with heavy armor. A magus can cast magus spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.</p>\n<h2>Greater Spell Combat (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the magus gains the ability to seamlessly cast spells and make melee attacks. Whenever he uses the spell combat ability, his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check bonus equals double the amount of the attack penalty taken.</p>\n<h2>Counterstrike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, whenever an enemy within reach of the magus successfully casts a spell defensively, that enemy provokes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>&nbsp;from the magus after the spell is complete. This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>&nbsp;cannot disrupt the spell.</p>\n<h2>Greater Spell Access (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 19th level, the magus gains access to an expanded spell list. He learns and places 14 spells from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard’s</a>&nbsp;spell list into his spellbook as magus spells of their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;level. He gains two of each of the following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;spells not on the magus spell list:</p>\n<p>0-level, 1st-level, 2nd-level, 3rd-level, 4th-level, 5th-level, and 6th-level.</p>\n<p>He can ignore the somatic component of these spells, casting them without the normal chance of spell failure.</p>\n<h2>True Magus (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the magus becomes a master of spells and combat. Whenever he uses his spell combat ability, he does not need to make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check to cast the spell defensively. Whenever the magus uses spell combat and his spell targets the same creature as his melee attacks, he can choose to either increase the DC to resist the spell by +2, grant himself a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on any checks made to overcome&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>, or grant himself a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;made against the target during his turn.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","effects":[]}

Out of honor, desperation, or tragic need, a vampire hunter pits his abilities not just against the creatures of the night, but also their terrifying undead overlords: vampires. Most vampire hunters do not survive their first encounters with vampirekind, as no amount of study or training can truly prepare one to face the Nobles of the night. Those few who survive and force themselves to carry on grow more and more like their terrible quarry, becoming dark-garbed bringers of death, feared by the dead and the living alike. Vampire hunters approach their duties with a grim but ironclad resolve so strong it resembles ecclesiastical faith, and it is from this mysterious, selfless dedication that their divine power wells.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Vampire hunters obsessively stalk their quarry— not just vampirekind, but all those supernatural beasts and undead terrors that serve the Nobility. These champions of the living track their blasphemous prey, learn their weaknesses, and bring them low. Doing so requires more than training and guile, though. To stand against the darkness, vampire hunters adopt a measure of their foes’ unnatural power, turning vampirekind’s sinister might back against them. Vampire hunters are the vanguard in the battle against evil, but know to value the perspective, support, and magic of other expert adventurers.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>:

A vampire hunter must meet the prerequisites for these feats to select them.

In effect, the vampire hunter loses the old feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or another ability the vampire hunter knows.

At 8th level, he is also affected as if by the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spider-climb\">spider climb</a>&nbsp;and can move normally through difficult terrain. At 16th level, he is treated as being under the effects of the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/freedom-of-movement\">freedom of movement</a>, and can use up to two consecutive move actions in the same turn to cross areas of open air or calm water (or similar substances) as if they were solid ground, though the vampire hunter must begin and end this movement on solid ground. This allows the vampire hunter to cross water, open air, lava (though he takes fire damage as normal if not immune), and the like without falling or sinking.</p>\n<p><strong>Vampiric Presence</strong>: The vampire hunter gains a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>.

The vampire hunter treats his level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;when using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like abilities</a>&nbsp;this ability grants.</p>\n<p><strong>Vampiric Resilience</strong>: The vampire hunter gains protection against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain\">energy drain</a>. Each time this vampiric focus is activated, the first two times he would gain a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels\">negative level</a>, he instead does not. At 8th level, the first four times he would gain a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels\">negative level</a>&nbsp;while this focus is activated, he does not. At 16th level, the first six times he would gain a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels\">negative level</a>&nbsp;while this focus is activated, he does not gain any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels\">negative levels</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Vampiric Resolve</strong>: The vampire hunter gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saving throws against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;effects. If he has already been affected by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;effect when he activates this focus, he can immediately reroll his saving throw against that effect with a bonus equal to half his vampire hunter level. At 16th level, he is immune to mindaffecting effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Vampiric Sight</strong>: The vampire hunter gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision\">darkvision</a>&nbsp;to a range of 60 feet (if he already has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision\">darkvision</a>, its range increases by 30 feet). At 8th level, the range of the vampire hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision\">darkvision</a>&nbsp;increases by 30 feet. At 16th level, the vampire hunter also gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense\">blindsense</a>&nbsp;to a range of 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>Relentless (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a vampire hunter can travel for an extended period of time without rest. The vampire hunter (and his mount, if he has one) can walk 16 hours in a day of travel without it being considered a forced march, but at the end of that day, he must attempt a DC 15&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw. If he fails, he can travel for 8 hours the following day, and he (as well as his mount, if he has one) is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>&nbsp;for the following 24 hours. If he succeeds at the saving throw, he can use this ability again the following day. The DC of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw increases by 2 for every additional day the vampire hunter has been traveling for more than 8 hours. The vampire hunter does not need to attempt a separate saving throw for his mount. After the vampire hunter rests for 24 hours, the saving throw DC resets to 15.</p>\n<h2>Stake (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, any piercing weapon or sharp tool (such as a piton) a vampire hunter drives through a vampire’s heart is treated as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/stake-wooden\">wooden stake</a>&nbsp;for purposes of creatures who are vulnerable to them. If this improvised stake is removed, the vampire returns to life as normal.</p>\n<h2>Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a vampire hunter gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-inquisitor\">inquisitor spell list</a>. He can cast any spell he knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. A vampire hunter cannot cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor\">inquisitor</a>&nbsp;orisons or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor\">inquisitor</a>&nbsp;spells that are higher than 4th level using this class feature.</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a spell, a vampire hunter must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-\">Difficulty Class</a>&nbsp;for a saving throw against a vampire hunter’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the vampire hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>A vampire hunter can cast can a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–1: Vampire Hunter. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score. When Table 1–1: Vampire Hunter indicates that vampire hunter can cast 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he can cast the number of bonus spells per day he would be entitled to based on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score for that spell level.</p>\n<p>A vampire hunter’s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a vampire hunter knows two 1st-level spells of the vampire hunter’s choice. At each new vampire hunter level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1–2: Vampire Hunter Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a vampire hunter knows is not affected by his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score. The numbers on Table 1–2 are fixed.) Upon reaching 7th level, and at every third vampire hunter level thereafter (7th and 13th), a vampire hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the vampire hunter “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level spell he can cast.</p>\n<p>The vampire hunter can swap out a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Every day the vampire hunter can allow a number of companions equal to half his level (plus their mounts) to also benefit from his relentless ability. The vampire hunter rolls saving throws to determine whether the group can carry on in its extended travels.</p>\n<h2>Vampire Tracker (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, the vampire hunter can track gaseous creatures—such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/vampire\">vampires</a>&nbsp;flying or moving in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form\">gaseous form</a>—as though they were leaving physical tracks. The base DC of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks to track gaseous creatures is 20. The modifiers for surfaces don’t apply (as a gaseous creature leaves no impressions during its passage) but other conditions do.</p>\n<h2>Swift Tracker (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 10th level, a vampire hunter can move at his normal speed while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to follow tracks without taking the normal –5 penalty. He takes a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>\n<h2>Vampire Bane (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, a vampire hunter can intensify a vampire’s revulsion to strongly presented holy symbols. When a vampire hunter uses a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to confront a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>&nbsp;with a presented&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Holy-Symbol\">holy symbol</a>, the vampire must attempt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saving throw (DC = 15 + the vampire hunter’s class level + the vampire hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier). On a failed save, the vampire is repulsed and must stay a number of feet from the vampire hunter equal to 5 times the vampire hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. Additionally, a vampire repulsed in this way cannot touch or make melee attacks against the vampire hunter (although the vampire can still touch and make melee attacks against the vampire hunter’s allies as normal). A vampire continues to be repulsed for every round the vampire hunter spends presenting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Holy-Symbol\">holy symbol</a>&nbsp;(a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>), though it can attempt a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;save every round to overcome its revulsion and act normally.</p>\n<p>The vampire hunter can use any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Holy-Symbol\">holy symbol</a>&nbsp;to repulse a vampire, but for the purposes of this ability, the vampire hunter treats his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier as being 2 higher when he employs the symbol of the deity he worships.</p>\n<h2>Remove Vampirism (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, the vampire hunter can prevent a creature killed by a vampire from returning to life as a vampire itself. By spending 10 minutes and dousing a body with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Vial\">vial</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Holy-Water\">holy water</a>, the vampire hunter removes the infection of vampirism from a creature slain by a vampire’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-\">blood drain</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain\">energy drain</a>&nbsp;ability, preventing it from rising as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/vampire-spawn\">vampire spawn</a>&nbsp;via a vampire’s create spawn ability. This effect cannot be undone with any magic weaker than a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle\">miracle</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish\">wish</a>. If the corpse is returned to life and subsequently killed by a vampire again might it become a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/vampire-spawn\">vampire spawn</a>.</p>\n<h2>Quarry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;a vampire hunter can denote one target within his line of sight that he knows is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a vampire hunter can take 10 on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically confirmed. A vampire hunter can have no more than one quarry at a time. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the vampire hunter sees proof that his quarry is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;or (somehow) was not actually&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>, he can select a new quarry after 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>Critical Reflexes (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, upon confirming a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>&nbsp;against an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creature, the vampire hunter can attempt a special&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check to produce an item and immediately use it upon that foe. The vampire hunter decides whether or not to use this ability after dealing additional damage for his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>. At that point, he can attempt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check against the target’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>&nbsp;(the target is denied its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier to resist this attack). If the vampire hunter succeeds, he produces a piece of equipment he has on his person and immediately uses that item upon the target creature. This ability does not provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>.</p>\n<p>Items used in this manner are typically alchemical items, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Acid\">acid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Holy-Water\">holy water</a>. Items that require attacks against the target automatically hit and deal damage as normal (potentially to the vampire hunter, as well, if the item affects an area). Items that would have no direct effect against the target (such as a fishing hook or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Lantern\">lantern</a>) or that require another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;to use (such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Rope\">rope</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Manacles\">manacles</a>) cannot be used as part of this ability. Other melee and ranged weapons cannot be used with this ability (with the exception of using a stake against a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>; see below).</p>\n<p>This ability can be used against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal\">incorporeal</a>&nbsp;creatures.</p>\n<p>If the target creature is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>&nbsp;and the vampire hunter has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/stake-wooden\">wooden stake</a>&nbsp;in his possession (or a similar item affected by his stake ability), he can drive the stake through the vampire’s heart as though it were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>, slaying it immediately. If the creature is not a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>, this attempt fails at the last moment; the vampire hunter realizes that the target is not a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>. A vampire hunter cannot drive a stake through the heart of a non-<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>&nbsp;using this ability.</p>\n<h2>Improved Quarry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 19th level, the vampire hunter’s ability to hunt his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, and can now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20\">take 20</a>&nbsp;while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to track his quarry while moving at normal speed, without penalty. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>\n<h2>Master Vampire Hunter (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the vampire hunter becomes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bane\">bane</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, he can make a single attack against his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;quarry at his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">attack bonus</a>&nbsp;while choosing one of the following effects: destroy, stake, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds.</p>\n<p>If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the vampire hunter’s level + the vampire hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. Whether or not the attack succeeds, the creature cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any vampire hunter) for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>If the vampire hunter chooses to destroy the target, the target is killed. If the target is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>, it does not assume&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form\">gaseous form</a>, and its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;powers do not come into effect; it is destroyed outright. If the vampire hunter chooses to stake his target, the target is killed if it’s a non-<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>. If it’s a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>&nbsp;(or similar creature affected by having a stake driven through its heart) it is killed, but returns to life if the stake is removed. The vampire hunter can use his 4th-level stake ability to employ any piercing weapon or sharp tool as though it were a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/stake-wooden\">wooden stake</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at 20th level, each day when the vampire hunter regains his spells per day, he chooses one vampiric focus to be active on himself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to uses of his vampiric focus class ability.</p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/stake.jpg","effects":[]}

Doing so requires an opposed driving check to get the corvus into the correct position, which is within the length of the corvus and adjacent to the other vehicle. Once a corvus is attached, it takes a Strength check as a full-round action to dislodge the corvus. Alternatively, if the corvus is attached to a vehicle, either vehicle driver can make a driving check as a standard action to dislodge the corvus (a check that succeeds by 5 or more destroys the corvus).</p>\n<p>The base DC for either of these checks is 15, and the DC increases by 5 for every Small or Medium creature currently standing on the corvus. If a corvus is disengaged while creatures are standing on it, those creatures must make a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or fall. Succeeding at the saving throw allows them to move to the nearest area of safe ground, but such movement provokes attacks of opportunity.

The device consists  of a cumbersome backpack  of two tanks and a swivelmounted,  handheld projection  unit, or \"lance.\" When the device  is aimed and a small hand lever  depressed, a small gas burner ignites the oil, which is  propelled forth in a blazing stream of intense flame. A  f lamethrower with full tanks is capable of unleashing up  to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect.</p><p></p><p>  When using a flamethrower, the wielder projects a  60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a separate attack roll  against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes  a -2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified  by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as  Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or  smoke, or the <em>blur</em>, <em>invisibility</em>, or <em>mirror image</em> spells, do not  foil this line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical  hit, the wielder confirms the critical for that roll alone.</p><p></p><p>  All affected creatures take 4d6 points of damage,  and any creature hit by the flaming stream must also  succeed at succeed at a DC 20 Ref lex save or catch fire,  taking an additional 2d6 points of damage each round  until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature  can attempt a new save as a full-round action, and  dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +2 bonus  on this save.</p><p></p><p>  The device's tanks and backpacks are awkward, and the  wielder takes a -4 armor check penalty when wearing the  cumbersome device. In addition, the tanks have hardness  10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured in the  presence of any adjacent flame (including the device's own  gas igniter), a mighty conflagration erupts, the wielder  takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and all creatures within a  20-foot radius take 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20  for half ).

When the cartridges strike their target they shatter exposing the radium powder within. The moment sunlight strikes this substance it explodes with considerable violence, making the weapons versatile for either direct fire or suppressive fire. Radium weapons follow the general rules for advanced firearms found in <em>Path?nder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Combat</em>.</p><p></p><p> All radium weapons use radium cartridges for ammunition. As a result. in addition to targeting specific creatures or objects. the wielder may fire a radium weapon at an unoccupied square similar to throwing a splash weapon (<em>Pathfinder RFC Core Rulebook 202</em>). All creatures within 15 feet of the targeted square take 2d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (Reflex DC 15 half).

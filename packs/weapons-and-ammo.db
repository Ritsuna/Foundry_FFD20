Reloading the mortar is a full-round action, and the user loads a grenade-like projectile into the breech of the weapon's steel barrel, along with a blank rifle round that propels the bomb when triggered.

When used for direct fire, they take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and their range increment is halved, but they do not have a minimum range. After the point of impact is determined, the shell explodes and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage to all creatures in a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 20 for half ).</p>\n<p>An Aasen mortar has hardness 10 and 35 hit points; it fires special, finned fragmentation bombs that cost 10 gp each and weigh 4 pounds each.

A barbazu beard can be used as an off-hand weapon that requires no hands to use; thus, a warrior could combine use of a barbazu beard with a two-handed weapon. It otherwise follows all rules for using an off-hand weapon. Attacking with a barbazu beard provokes an attack of opportunity. Because it is so close to the wearer's face, using a barbazu beard against creatures harmful to touch (such as fire elementals and acidic oozes) has the same risks as using a natural weapon or unarmed strike against these creatures.</p><p></p><p> A barbazu beard is a light melee exotic weapon.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":5,"price":25,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":2,"value":2},"hardness":10,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Barbazu Beard","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"barbazuBeard","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"masterwork":false,"nonlethal":false,"weaponType":"exotic","weaponSubtype":"light","properties":{"blc":false,"brc":false,"dbl":false,"dis":false,"fin":false,"frg":false,"imp":false,"mnk":false,"nnl":false,"prf":false,"rch":false,"thr":false,"trp":false,"grp":false,"snd":false,"dea":false,"dst":false},"enh":null,"weaponData":{"damageRoll":"1d4","damageType":"S","critRange":20,"critMult":2,"range":0,"attackFormula":"","damageFormula":"","size":"med","maxRangeIncrements":1},"broken":false,"bonus":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damage2":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damage2Type":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damage":{"parts":[]},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/ffd20/icons/items/weapons/barbazu-beard.png","effects":[]}

The head is connected to the pole by a single weak bolt, giving the weapon the fragile condition. When you use a barbed spear to attack a creature that is prone, flying above you, or at least one size category larger than you, you can make a melee attack with a -4 penalty to jam the barbed head into the target's foot. If you're successful, the target takes 1 point of damage and the barbed head breaks off in the target's foot. The barb then acts as a caltrop, wounding the creature's foot and halving its speed. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is treated with a successful DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of magical healing. Like caltrops, barbed spears may not work against unusual opponents. A barbed spear that embeds its caltrop-like head into a target's foot gains the broken condition, and can't be used as a weapon until it's repaired.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":10,"price":15,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":10,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Barbed Spear","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"barbedSpear","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"masterwork":false,"nonlethal":false,"weaponType":"exotic","weaponSubtype":"2h","properties":{"blc":false,"brc":false,"dbl":false,"dis":false,"fin":false,"frg":true,"grp":false,"imp":false,"mnk":false,"nnl":false,"prf":false,"rch":true,"snd":false,"thr":false,"trp":false,"dea":false,"dst":false},"enh":null,"weaponData":{"damageRoll":"1d6","damageType":"P","critRange":20,"critMult":2,"range":0,"attackFormula":"","damageFormula":"","size":"med","maxRangeIncrements":1},"broken":false,"bonus":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damage2":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damage2Type":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/weapons/polearms/spear-simple-barbed.webp","effects":[],"_id":"huwXevOSIgMnwPgl"}

A corvus is usually 10 feet wide and 15 feet long. It has a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points per square.</p>\n<p>Using a corvus requires a DC 10 Profession (siege engineer) check as a full-round action; if the check fails, the corvus fails to catch on the target and must be reset (a full-round action). A corvus mounted on a vehicle can target another moving vehicle (see Chapter 4: Vehicles). Doing so requires an opposed driving check to get the corvus into the correct position, which is within the length of the corvus and adjacent to the other vehicle. Once a corvus is attached, it takes a Strength check as a full-round action to dislodge the corvus. Alternatively, if the corvus is attached to a vehicle, either vehicle driver can make a driving check as a standard action to dislodge the corvus (a check that succeeds by 5 or more destroys the corvus).</p>\n<p>The base DC for either of these checks is 15, and the DC increases by 5 for every Small or Medium creature currently standing on the corvus. If a corvus is disengaged while creatures are standing on it, those creatures must make a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or fall. Succeeding at the saving throw allows them to move to the nearest area of safe ground, but such movement provokes attacks of opportunity. A corvus cannot be armored.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":100,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":10,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Corvus","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"corvus","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"equipped":true,"masterwork":false,"nonlethal":false,"weaponType":"misc","weaponSubtype":"other","properties":{"blc":false,"brc":false,"dea":false,"dis":false,"dst":false,"dbl":false,"fin":false,"frg":false,"grp":false,"imp":false,"mnk":false,"nnl":false,"prf":false,"rch":false,"snd":false,"thr":false,"trp":false},"enh":null,"weaponData":{"damageRoll":"","damageType":"","critRange":"NULL","critMult":"2","range":0,"attackFormula":"","damageFormula":"","size":"med","maxRangeIncrements":1},"broken":false,"bonus":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damage2":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damage2Type":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/wood/framing-reinforced-brown.webp","effects":[],"_id":"rW1loOMX2unzeREU"}

The device consists  of a cumbersome backpack  of two tanks and a swivelmounted,  handheld projection  unit, or \"lance.\" When the device  is aimed and a small hand lever  depressed, a small gas burner ignites the oil, which is  propelled forth in a blazing stream of intense flame. A  f lamethrower with full tanks is capable of unleashing up  to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect.</p><p></p><p>  When using a flamethrower, the wielder projects a  60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a separate attack roll  against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes  a -2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified  by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as  Vital Strike.

Radium weapons fire special cartridges that must be manufactured under artificial light, as exposure to sunlight results in an explosion. When the cartridges strike their target they shatter exposingthe radium powder within.

All creatures within 15 feet of the targeted square take 2d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (Reflex DC 15 half).

Bombards are normally fired indirectly, but can also be fired as direct-fire siege engines.

The bombard is unscrewed to be loaded, and then the main part of the muzzle is screwed back on to the barrel section in order to be fired. Heavy bombards are too large and powerful to mount on vehicles. The targeting DC of a heavy bombard is 25. A heavy bombard has a misfire range of 1-2 (30 feet).

When the cartridges strike their target they shatter exposing the radium powder within.

As a result. in addition to targeting specific creatures or objects. the wielder may fire a radium weapon at an unoccupied square similar to throwing a splash weapon (<em>Pathfinder RFC Core Rulebook 202</em>). All creatures within 15 feet of the targeted square take 2d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (Reflex DC 15 half).

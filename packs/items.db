If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br><br>Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br><br>Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br><br>Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br><br>Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br><br>Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br><br>Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>"},"tags":[],"price":15,"identifiedName":"Black Cumin","changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

A single dose of black powder is enough to power a single shot from most one-handed and two-handed firearms, while 10 doses are required to fire a cannon. Black powder is often stored and transported in kegs (which hold 100 doses), but in this quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous. Exposure to fire, electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder to explode—a single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of fire damage to anyone within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing black powder in a powder horn protects the powder from explosion.</p>"},"tags":[],"weight":5,"price":1000,"identifiedName":"Black powder (Keg)","changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After all, few adventurers have the time or inclination to write scholarly tomes about their experiences, so it falls to researchers and chroniclers to piece together dungeon guides.

When falling, a creature wearing a billow cape is treated as if he had deliberately jumped from the height. When worn in areas of strong wind or greater, a billow cape hampers movement. In such wind conditions, the wearer treats all terrain as difficult terrain and takes a -4 penalty on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly\">Fly</a> checks. Because of the strange and somewhat fragile construction of this cape, only Small or smaller billow capes function properly.

A dungeon guide only makes sense in context, and thus cannot be consulted outside of the relevant dungeon except for the briefest and most general information about the dungeon in question.</p>\r\n<p>When a PC consults a dungeon guide, the GM makes an accuracy check for the guide by secretly rolling a d20 and adding the guide's accuracy modifier to the roll. The GM then compares the result of the accuracy check to the DC of the information being sought (see the Accuracy Check DCs table). A GM may modify these DCs at her discretion. If the result is equal to or greater than the accuracy check DC, the GM should give the PC a clue or some knowledge about an aspect of the area in question. For example, the book might mention some historical detail of the room's original purpose, how to disarm an obstructive mechanism, where an exit leads, or if the area is a good place to rest.</p>\r\n<p>If the dungeon guide's accuracy check fails by 4 or less, the book doesn't have any relevant information on the area in question. If the dungeon guide fails the check by 5 or more, the GM should provide the PC with seemingly true information that is actually inaccurate or dangerous in some way. For example, the guide might reveal that there is a trap in the room, but give the wrong location for it.</p>\r\n<p>If a PC possesses ranks in the dungeon guide's associated skill, he may attempt a skill check with the associated skill each time he consults the guide. If his check surpasses the guide's associated skill DC, the guide receives a +2 bonus on its next accuracy check and the PC cannot receive inaccurate information from the guide should it fail this accuracy check by 5 or more (in this case the PC simply receives no pertinent information from consulting the text that time).</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Accuracy Check DCs</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th class=\"text\">DC</th>\r\n<th class=\"text\">Task</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"number\">20</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Determine a mechanism's function</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"number\">20</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Determine whether an area is a safe place to rest</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"number\">25</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Fill in the next area of the map</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"number\">25</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Get a hint on how to solve a puzzle</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"number\">20</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Get a vague idea of nearby rooms</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"text\">10 + creature's CR</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Identify a commonly encountered dungeon denizen</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"number\">10</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Identify a room's original purpose</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"text\">10 + <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/\">trap's</a> CR</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Locate a hidden <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/\">trap</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"number\">15</td>\r\n<td class=\"text\">Locate a nearby source of food or water</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n"},"tags":[],"weight":2,"price":50,"changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>"},"tags":[],"price":20,"identifiedName":"Flaming sumac","changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

Oread jewelers found that these crystals, dubbed fleshgems, seemed to feed on the elemental energy that permeates an oread's flesh, growing from tiny chips of stone into large, elaborate gemstones. Essentially harmless, implanting fleshgems became a unique racial method of body alteration among oreads, equivalent to tattoos and piercings among other <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoids</a>. Decorative fleshgems cost 1 gp and are merely ornamental. Fleshgem spikes, on the other hand, grow into elaborate crystalline shards that function as armor spikes, but the oread wearing them cannot wear armor over the spikes and even normal clothing requires special holes or seams to allow the spikes to stick out. Implanting a set of fleshgem spikes takes 10 minutes, and the resulting shard takes about a week to grow to full size. Removing a fleshgem takes 1 minute; the person removing the gem must make a successful DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal\">Heal</a> check to avoid dealing 1d4 points of damage to the oread.

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>"},"tags":[],"price":30,"identifiedName":"Golden cardamom","changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

Readying and firing a jetcaster requires two hands.<br><br>If a jetcaster fires ordinary powder or oil, each square in the cone is coated in that substance. If a jetcaster fires holy water, itching powder, or sneezing powder, treat each square in the cone as a square of impact and each square adjacent to the cone (including the wielder’s) as an adjacent square for the purpose of determining effects and DCs.

A manacled creature can use the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist\">Escape Artist</a> skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a> check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a> 10 and 10 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>.</p>\n<p>Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.</p>\n<p>For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.

Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.</p>\n<p><strong>Expanded Information</strong></p>\n<p class=\"source\"><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mhZQW1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PZO9293</a></p>\n<p><strong>Fetters</strong>: These manacles are specifically designed to fit around the ankles, and use the same rules for breaking, escape, and cost relative to size. A creature in fetters is entangled and can move at only half speed. In addition, a fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a> check to move more than its (reduced) speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls prone.</p>\n<p><strong>Frontal Restraint</strong>: A creature whose wrists are bound with manacles can wield only one melee weapon or shield in combat (the weapon may be a two-handed weapon). It cannot make use of ranged weapons, except for crossbows (but even these cannot be reloaded by the bound creature). Any attack the creature makes while manacled takes a -4 penalty. The creature can attempt skill checks using its hands, but at a -5 penalty (-15 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing).</p>\n<p><strong>Rear Restraint</strong>: Manacles might be employed to keep a creature's hands behind its back. In such cases, the creature cannot use its hands to effectively employ any weapon or shield. The creature can attempt to use its hands to perform a skill, but at a -10 penalty (-25 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing). While manacled, a creature can attempt to flip its arms beneath its legs, bringing its hands in front of itself. This requires a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a separate Escape Artist check is then required to escape the manacles).</p>\n<p><strong>Restraining Two Individuals</strong>: Two creatures might share one set of manacles. While manacled together, the manacled individuals must remain adjacent to one another. If they are not working together, they are both treated as grappled. If they are working together, they can move together in the same round (using the movement speed of the slower creature). A manacled creature can forfeit its turn during combat to mimic the other manacled creature's movements, allowing that creature to act as if unrestrained.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":2,"price":15,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Manacles, Common","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"links":{"children":[]},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"weightConverted":2,"weightUnits":"lbs","priceUnits":"gp"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.ffd20.items.zompehbhvegvncwu"}},"img":"systems/ffd20/icons/items/inventory/dice.jpg","effects":[],"labels":{"equipped":"<i class=\"fas fa-times\"></i>","carried":"<i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>","identified":"<i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>"},"hasAttack":false,"hasMultiAttack":false,"hasDamage":false,"hasAction":false,"showUnidentifiedData":false,"isStack":false,"isCharged":false,"price":15,"empty":false,"totalWeight":2,"units":"lbs"},{"_id":"ucgkbtqiybhyiwwk","name":"Pouch, Spell Component","permission":{"default":0,"T9i9xVjdkHeFZC72":3},"type":"loot","data":{"subType":"gear","description":{"value":"\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 5 gp; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>\r\n<p>A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the material <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a> and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a> that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch.

You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.<br><br>Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature’s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature’s speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.<br><br>Caltrops may not work against unusual opponents.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":2,"price":1,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Caltrops","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"links":{"children":[]},"damage":{"parts":[]},"weightConverted":2,"weightUnits":"lbs","priceUnits":"gp"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.ffd20.items.yGrLgCtNMMV9cUvt"}},"img":"systems/ffd20/icons/items/inventory/dice.jpg","effects":[],"labels":{"equipped":"<i class=\"fas fa-times\"></i>","carried":"<i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>","identified":"<i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>"},"hasAttack":false,"hasMultiAttack":false,"hasDamage":false,"hasAction":false,"showUnidentifiedData":false,"isStack":false,"isCharged":false,"price":1,"empty":false,"totalWeight":2,"units":"lbs"},{"_id":"nbbqukzwghrixhyl","name":"Chalk","permission":{"default":0,"T9i9xVjdkHeFZC72":3},"type":"loot","data":{"subType":"gear","description":{"value":"\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <a title=\"PZO1110\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601251505/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601251505&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PZO1110</a></p>\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 1 cp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>\r\n<p>This fat piece of white chalk easily marks wood, metal, or stone.

For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount.

A creature in fetters is entangled and can move at only half speed. In addition, a fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a> check to move more than its (reduced) speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls prone.</p>\n<p><strong>Frontal Restraint</strong>: A creature whose wrists are bound with manacles can wield only one melee weapon or shield in combat (the weapon may be a two-handed weapon). It cannot make use of ranged weapons, except for crossbows (but even these cannot be reloaded by the bound creature). Any attack the creature makes while manacled takes a -4 penalty. The creature can attempt skill checks using its hands, but at a -5 penalty (-15 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing).</p>\n<p><strong>Rear Restraint</strong>: Manacles might be employed to keep a creature's hands behind its back. In such cases, the creature cannot use its hands to effectively employ any weapon or shield. The creature can attempt to use its hands to perform a skill, but at a -10 penalty (-25 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing). While manacled, a creature can attempt to flip its arms beneath its legs, bringing its hands in front of itself. This requires a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a separate Escape Artist check is then required to escape the manacles).</p>\n<p><strong>Restraining Two Individuals</strong>: Two creatures might share one set of manacles. While manacled together, the manacled individuals must remain adjacent to one another. If they are not working together, they are both treated as grappled. If they are working together, they can move together in the same round (using the movement speed of the slower creature). A manacled creature can forfeit its turn during combat to mimic the other manacled creature's movements, allowing that creature to act as if unrestrained.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":2,"price":15,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Manacles, Common","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"links":{"children":[]},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"weightConverted":2,"weightUnits":"lbs","priceUnits":"gp"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.ffd20.items.zompehbhvegvncwu"}},"img":"systems/ffd20/icons/items/inventory/dice.jpg","effects":[],"labels":{"equipped":"<i class=\"fas fa-times\"></i>","carried":"<i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>","identified":"<i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>"},"hasAttack":false,"hasMultiAttack":false,"hasDamage":false,"hasAction":false,"showUnidentifiedData":false,"isStack":false,"isCharged":false,"price":15,"empty":false,"totalWeight":2,"units":"lbs"}],"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

Creatures attempting to access gear protected by a bell net must succeed at a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check to avoid chiming the bells. Hearing the chiming bells of a bell net requires a DC 0 Perception check. Because the many bells chime when you move, traveling with a bell net gives you a -2 penalty on Stealth checks. <b>Price</b> 2 gp; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>\r\n<p><b>Butterfly net</b> One end of this 6-foot-long pole supports a wide metal hoop covered by a thin mesh net. You can use this to sift objects from material capable of passing through the net, such as sand or water. You can also use a butterfly net to capture Fine or Diminutive creatures as if it were a net (weapon), though you don't need to re-fold the butterfly net if you miss, and you use the handle of the butterfly net like you would the rope of a net weapon. <b>Price</b> 5 gp; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>\r\n<p><b>Fishing net</b> This net measures 5 feet by 5 feet, and can be used to cover a pit or to block Tiny or larger creatures from entering an area. <b>Price</b> 4 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p>\r\n<p><b>Camouflage netting</b> This loose mesh of twine and varicolored cloth is used to disguise the presence of creatures or large objects. Camouflage netting must be manufactured to provide camouflage in a single type of terrain, such as snow, sand, forest, grass, swamp, urban, or water. When you hide under the netting in the appropriate terrain, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering up with camouflage netting is a full-round action requiring a DC 10 Survival check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the netting and do not gain its bonus on Stealth checks). You have the entangled condition when using the netting, except your Dexterity penalty does not affect your initiative or Stealth checks. Taking off camouflage netting is a move action, or a swift action if combined with a move action to stand up from a prone position.</p>\r\n<p>You may spend 1 minute covering an object with camouflage netting. Make a Survival check with a -10 penalty and use the total as the Stealth check result for the object. Creatures who fail a Perception check against this Stealth DC do not recognize what the object is and usually treat it as a natural part of the terrain. For example, you can conceal a wagon as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two nets. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five nets and takes 10 minutes of work, and the Survival check penalty is -20 instead of -10. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 camouflage nets and takes 1 hour of work, and the Survival check penalty is -30 instead of -10.</p>\r\n<p>A creature with the scent ability ignores the effect of camouflage netting and makes checks against your actual Stealth roll when in scent range.

Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical&nbsp;spirit planchettes&nbsp;allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of&nbsp;spirit planchettes&nbsp;exist&mdash;brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A&nbsp;spirit planchette&nbsp;requires a board to move upon, but this &ldquo;board&rdquo; can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface&mdash;it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work.<br /><br />To use a&nbsp;spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette&rsquo;s surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board&mdash;at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the s&eacute;ance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below. The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;no,&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybe,&rdquo; or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A&nbsp;spirit planchette&nbsp;may be used once per day&mdash;the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below).<br /><br />Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a&nbsp;spirit planchette&nbsp;is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a &ndash;2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of&nbsp;spirit planchette&nbsp;being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient&mdash;the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically &ldquo;maybe.&rdquo; If the GM determines that the spirits are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the spirits speak truthfully or whether they lie.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Planchette Type</td>\n<td>Questions per Use</td>\n<td>Will Save DC</td>\n<td>Confusion Duration</td>\n<td>True Answer</td>\n<td>Lie</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1 round</td>\n<td>01-60</td>\n<td>61-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cold Iron</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>2 rounds</td>\n<td>01-75</td>\n<td>76-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>3 rounds</td>\n<td>01-90</td>\n<td>91-100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Construction</h3>\n<p>Requirements&nbsp;Craft Wondrous Item,&nbsp;contact other planes,&nbsp;speak with dead;&nbsp;Cost&nbsp;2,000 gp (brass spirit planchette), 5,000 gp (cold iron spirit planchette), 9,000 gp (silver spirit planchette)</p>"},"tags":[],"weight":5,"price":4000,"identifiedName":"Spirit planchette","changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a> with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled\">entangled</a> creature takes a -2 penalty on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a> and a -4 penalty to <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a> and must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a> save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a> save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.</p>\r\n<p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a> check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled\">entangled</a> creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a> check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell.

Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>"},"tags":[],"price":25,"identifiedName":"Tiger cloves","changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>"},"tags":[],"price":5,"identifiedName":"Violet salt","changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

If you gather herbs while traveling, your overland speed is halved. Spending 8 hours doing nothing but gathering herbs from the area grants 1 additional yield of each herb you're gathering.</p>\r\n<p>When you start your day of herb gathering, you must declare which herb you are looking for. If you have 5 ranks of <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a> (herbalist), you can search for two different types of herbs at once, and for each additional 5 ranks you have in this skill, you can search for one additional herb, to a maximum of 5 herbs at once if you have 20 ranks in <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a> (herbalist).</p>\r\n<p>Each herb listed below has a gather DC. At the end of the time spent gathering, attempt a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a> (herbalist) or <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (nature) check against each herb's gather DC. If the terrain you are searching in is one of your favored terrains, you can attempt a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a> check instead. If the herb in question is present in the region you searched (this is always subject to the GM's discretion), success results in a single yield of that herb. Success by 5 or more grants 1 extra yield. Success by 10 or more grants 2 extra yields.</p>\r\n<p>A single yield of herb weighs 1/10 of a pound unless otherwise noted in its yield section in the stats below.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to determining whether a particular herb is available to gather in a region, the GM also determines how many attempts to gather that herb can be attempted in the region. Typically, a region can support 1d4 herb-gathering expeditions before the herbs must be given 2d6 months to regrow.</p>\r\n<p><b>Preparing Herbs</b>: Most herbs must be prepared to unlock their potency. If this is the case for an herb, its stat block describes the method required to process it, the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a> (alchemy) DC to accomplish this task, and the amount of time needed to do so. A <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a> (herbalist) check can be conducted instead of a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a> (alchemy), but the DC of the check to prepare the herb increases by 5 in this case. If the preparer fails this check by 5 or more, the dose of the herb is ruined; if she fails by less, she can try again with the same herbs.</p>\r\n<p><b>Preparing Multiple Herbs</b>: An herbalist can normally prepare one type of herb per day, but she can prepare a number of doses of that single type of herb equal to her ranks in <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a> (herbalist). An herbalist with 7 or more ranks in <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a> (herbalist) can simultaneously prepare a second type of herb. At 14 ranks in <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a> (herbalist), the character can prepare up to three types of herbs at the same time.</p>\r\n<p><b>Herb Lifespan</b>: A raw, unprepared herb spoils 24 hours after it is harvested. A prepared herb spoils after 1 month unless otherwise noted in its Use entry.</p>\r\n<p>The herbs presented below are intended to represent a wide range of helpful plants; you can use these as examples for the creation of new herbs. Each herb is presented in its own stat block.</p>\r\n<p>The first line of the block presents the name and the price the herb is sold for in markets and herbalist shops. This is followed by a brief description of the herb's appearance.</p>\r\n<p>The next entry provides the DC of the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a> (herbalist) check to find and gather the herb with a day's worth of work. This is followed by the yield-the base number of doses that can be gathered each day. Extra yields can be gained with greater success on a gathering roll or by taking an entire day to do nothing but gather herbs.</p>\r\n<p>After that, the block provides the terrain the herb appears in. This is followed by information about how the herb must be prepared in order for it to be used. Finally, the use for the prepared herb is detailed at the end of the stat block. Applying, eating, or using a prepared herb typically requires a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a> that provokes <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>, unless otherwise specified in the description.</p>\r\n"},"tags":[],"price":100,"changes":[],"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"flags":{"boolean":[],"dictionary":[]},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","equipped":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

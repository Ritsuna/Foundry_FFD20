Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gil); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist — brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this “board” can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface — it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work.<p>To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette's surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board — at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the s&eacute;ance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below. The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” or “maybe,” or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day — the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below).<p>Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a -2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient — the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically “maybe.” If the GM determines that the spirits are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the spirits speak truthfully or whether they lie.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Planchette Type</td>\n<td>Questions per Use</td>\n<td>Will Save DC</td>\n<td>Confusion Duration</td>\n<td>True Answer</td>\n<td>Lie</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1 round</td>\n<td>01-60</td>\n<td>61-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cold Iron</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>2 rounds</td>\n<td>01-75</td>\n<td>76-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>3 rounds</td>\n<td>01-90</td>\n<td>91-100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Construction</h3>\n<p>Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, contact other planes, speak with dead; Cost 2,000 gil (brass spirit planchette), 5,000 gil (cold iron spirit planchette), 9,000 gil (silver spirit planchette)</p>"},"weight":{"value":5},"price":4000,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<p>Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gil and seasons 14 meals.<p>Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gil and seasons six meals.<p>Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gil and seasons nine meals.<p>Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gil and seasons 12 meals.<p>Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gil and seasons 10 meals.<p>Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gil and seasons one meal.<p>Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gil and seasons one meal.</p>"},"price":15,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

When the wielder compresses the air bladders (a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity), the jetcaster sprays its ammunition in a 10-foot cone. Most adventurers use a jetcaster to spray powder over invisible foes or holy water over incorporeal undead, but it can also spray oil, itching powder, sneezing powder, or other mundane dusts and liquids.<p>Loading the ammunition bladder is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and requires either a 4-pint jug of liquid (weighing up to 4 pounds) or a 4-pound sack of powder; insufficient ammunition causes it to misfire harmlessly. Refilling the air bladders is a move action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. Readying and firing a jetcaster requires two hands.<p>If a jetcaster fires ordinary powder or oil, each square in the cone is coated in that substance. If a jetcaster fires holy water, itching powder, or sneezing powder, treat each square in the cone as a square of impact and each square adjacent to the cone (including the wielder’s) as an adjacent square for the purpose of determining effects and DCs. Loading a jetcaster with unstable compounds such as acid or alchemist’s fire destroys the device.</p>"},"weight":{"value":6},"price":80,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br><br>Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gil and seasons 14 meals.<br><br>Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gil and seasons six meals.<br><br>Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gil and seasons nine meals.<br><br>Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gil and seasons 12 meals.<br><br>Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gil and seasons 10 meals.<br><br>Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gil and seasons one meal.<br><br>Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gil and seasons one meal.</p>"},"price":20,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

After all, few adventurers have the time or inclination to write scholarly tomes about their experiences, so it falls to researchers and chroniclers to piece together dungeon guides. To do so, they draw on books of lore and accounts of dungeons before the sites became the abodes of monsters, scour the diaries and reminiscences of retired adventurers, consult extraplanar intelligences, and fill in the gaps with wild guesswork.</p>\n<p>Dungeon guides vary in their reliability. Some read like tour guides of famous dungeons, dwelling on gory tales of monsters and exaggerated claims about treasure.

If you gather herbs while traveling, your overland speed is halved. Spending 8 hours doing nothing but gathering herbs from the area grants 1 additional yield of each herb you're gathering.</p>\n<p>When you start your day of herb gathering, you must declare which herb you are looking for. If you have 5 ranks of <em>Profession</em> (herbalist), you can search for two different types of herbs at once, and for each additional 5 ranks you have in this skill, you can search for one additional herb, to a maximum of 5 herbs at once if you have 20 ranks in <em>Profession</em> (herbalist).</p>\n<p>Each herb listed below has a gather DC. At the end of the time spent gathering, attempt a <em>Profession</em> (herbalist) or <em>Knowledge</em> (nature) check against each herb's gather DC. If the terrain you are searching in is one of your favored terrains, you can attempt a <em>Survival</em> check instead. If the herb in question is present in the region you searched (this is always subject to the GM's discretion), success results in a single yield of that herb. Success by 5 or more grants 1 extra yield. Success by 10 or more grants 2 extra yields.</p>\n<p>A single yield of herb weighs 1/10 of a pound unless otherwise noted in its yield section in the stats below.</p>\n<p>In addition to determining whether a particular herb is available to gather in a region, the GM also determines how many attempts to gather that herb can be attempted in the region. Typically, a region can support 1d4 herb-gathering expeditions before the herbs must be given 2d6 months to regrow.</p>\n<p><b>Preparing Herbs</b>: Most herbs must be prepared to unlock their potency. If this is the case for an herb, its stat block describes the method required to process it, the <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC to accomplish this task, and the amount of time needed to do so. A <em>Profession</em> (herbalist) check can be conducted instead of a <em>Craft</em> (alchemy), but the DC of the check to prepare the herb increases by 5 in this case. If the preparer fails this check by 5 or more, the dose of the herb is ruined; if she fails by less, she can try again with the same herbs.</p>\n<p><b>Preparing Multiple Herbs</b>: An herbalist can normally prepare one type of herb per day, but she can prepare a number of doses of that single type of herb equal to her ranks in <em>Profession</em> (herbalist). An herbalist with 7 or more ranks in <em>Profession</em> (herbalist) can simultaneously prepare a second type of herb. At 14 ranks in <em>Profession</em> (herbalist), the character can prepare up to three types of herbs at the same time.</p>\n<p><b>Herb Lifespan</b>: A raw, unprepared herb spoils 24 hours after it is harvested. A prepared herb spoils after 1 month unless otherwise noted in its Use entry.</p>\n<p>The herbs presented below are intended to represent a wide range of helpful plants; you can use these as examples for the creation of new herbs. Each herb is presented in its own stat block.</p>\n<p>The first line of the block presents the name and the price the herb is sold for in markets and herbalist shops. This is followed by a brief description of the herb's appearance.</p>\n<p>The next entry provides the DC of the <em>Profession</em> (herbalist) check to find and gather the herb with a day's worth of work. This is followed by the yield-the base number of doses that can be gathered each day. Extra yields can be gained with greater success on a gathering roll or by taking an entire day to do nothing but gather herbs.</p>\n<p>After that, the block provides the terrain the herb appears in. This is followed by information about how the herb must be prepared in order for it to be used. Finally, the use for the prepared herb is detailed at the end of the stat block. Applying, eating, or using a prepared herb typically requires a <em>standard action</em> that provokes <em>attacks of opportunity</em>, unless otherwise specified in the description.</p>"},"price":100,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

This is a <em>poison</em> effect, but creatures with the <em>goblinoid</em> subtype are immune to the effect. Innovative characters (including many <em>goblins</em>) have developed other uses for goblinvine, including as snares and ropes to make those bound or <em>entangled</em> itchy as well, but since goblinvine is relatively fragile, it makes for a very poor substitute for <em>rope</em>.</p>"},"weight":{"value":1},"price":30,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br><br>Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gil and seasons 14 meals.<br><br>Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gil and seasons six meals.<br><br>Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gil and seasons nine meals.<br><br>Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gil and seasons 12 meals.<br><br>Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gil and seasons 10 meals.<br><br>Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gil and seasons one meal.<br><br>Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gil and seasons one meal.</p>"},"price":30,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

A DC 15 <em>Heal</em> check can temporarily soothe these sensations, negating the <em>sickened</em> condition for 1 hour. Creatures immune or resistant to fire are immune to this sickening effect.

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br><br>Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gil and seasons 14 meals.<br><br>Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gil and seasons six meals.<br><br>Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gil and seasons nine meals.<br><br>Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gil and seasons 12 meals.<br><br>Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gil and seasons 10 meals.<br><br>Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gil and seasons one meal.<br><br>Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gil and seasons one meal.</p>"},"price":100,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

You have the entangled condition when using the netting, except your Dexterity penalty does not affect your initiative or Stealth checks. Taking off camouflage netting is a move action, or a swift action if combined with a move action to stand up from a prone position.</p>\n<p>You may spend 1 minute covering an object with camouflage netting. Make a Survival check with a -10 penalty and use the total as the Stealth check result for the object. Creatures who fail a Perception check against this Stealth DC do not recognize what the object is and usually treat it as a natural part of the terrain. For example, you can conceal a wagon as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two nets. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five nets and takes 10 minutes of work, and the Survival check penalty is -20 instead of -10. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 camouflage nets and takes 1 hour of work, and the Survival check penalty is -30 instead of -10.</p>\n<p>A creature with the scent ability ignores the effect of camouflage netting and makes checks against your actual Stealth roll when in scent range. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by camouflage netting automatically recognizes it as an object covered in camouflage. <b>Price</b> 20 gil; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p>"},"weight":{"value":2},"price":2,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br><br>Black Cumin: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gil and seasons 14 meals.<br><br>Flaming Sumac: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease’s effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gil and seasons six meals.<br><br>Golden Cardamom: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual’s body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gil and seasons nine meals.<br><br>Striped Nutmeg: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gil and seasons 12 meals.<br><br>Sunrise Cinnamon: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gil and seasons 10 meals.<br><br>Tiger Cloves: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gil and seasons one meal.<br><br>Violet Salt: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body’s water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gil and seasons one meal.</p>"},"price":15,"equipped":false,"subType":"gear"}}

They also have a substantial military presence in the Middle Lands, namely the continent of Quon, where they have a small outpost called Ghelsba in the Ronfaure region, and a large stronghold known as Davoi in the Norvallen region. These settlements are very close to the Elvaan Kingdom of San d&rsquo;Oria, and are lead by Overlord Bakgodek.</p>\n<p>Orcs are born with an innate lust for battle, which is put to good use, living in a society that requires all to participate in military training. Strength is valued above all in the orcish society, with the strongest among them rising in influence and power. All orcs&ndash;male and female&ndash;are required to participate in years of military training, and even their social structure is based on military ranks.</p>\n<p>Most orcs choose to follow the physical side of combat, becoming warriors, monks, dragoons, even archers, while others choose to incorporate magic into their tactics, becoming dark knights or holy knights. Others still choose to forgo physical combat completely and become black mages. These orcs are often known as Shamans and are presumably held in very high regard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/beastman-tribes/orc/\">View Orc on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">12 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(13 &ndash; 16 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(13 &ndash; 18 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d6 years<br />(14 &ndash; 24 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">20 years</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">30</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">40</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d20<br />(41 - 60 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">5 ft. 1 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d12 in.<br />(5 ft. 3 in. &ndash; 7 ft. 1 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">160 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d12x7 lbs.)<br />(174 &ndash; 328 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 9 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d12 in.<br />(4 ft. 11 in. &ndash; 6 ft. 9 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">120 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d12x7 lbs.)<br />(134 &ndash; 288 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Orcs are brutal and savage.

This racial trait replaces low-light vision.</li>\n<li>Feral:&nbsp;Orcs have the ability to fend for themselves long before they master the rudiments of their language and culture.

Orcs with this racial trait gain Survival as a class skill and gain a +1 racial bonus on melee weapon attack and damage rolls when at negative hit points.

This racial trait replaces skill bonus and the starting ability score racial traits.</li>\n<li>Reckless Climber:&nbsp;Mountain-dwelling orcs thrive on taking insane risks to defeat foes and show up rivals. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks without rope and on Acrobatics checks to maintain balance.

This racial trait replaces skill bonus.</li>\n<li>Stalker:&nbsp;Perception and Stealth are always class skills for orcs.

An orc that uses warcry grants himself +2 to attack and damage rolls to himself and all other allies within 30 foot radius of himself. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to the orc&rsquo;s Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

They gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) become class skills for them. If they choose a class that has either of these Knowledge skills as class skills, they gain a +2 racial bonus on those skills instead.</li>\n<li>Integrated:&nbsp;Humes gain a +1 racial bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Knowledge (local) checks.</li>\n<li>Skilled:&nbsp;Humes gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level.</li>\n<li>Sociable:&nbsp;When humes attempt to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude with a Diplomacy check and fail by 5 or more, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above.

Choose one humanoid race without the hume subtype. You start play with that race&rsquo;s languages and gain that race&rsquo;s weapon familiarity racial trait (if any). If the race does not have weapon familiarity, you gain either Skill Focus or Weapon Focus as a bonus feat that is appropriate for that race instead. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Alchemically Enhanced:&nbsp;Some humes use alchemical or scientific enhancements to push their bodies beyond the limits of nature. However, doing so comes at a significant price. A hume with this trait gains a +3 racial bonus to Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength. However, the character&rsquo;s biology is now more susceptible to chemicals, causing her to take a &ndash;2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws against poison. This racial trait replaces the +2 bonus to any one ability score and the bonus feat racial trait.</li>\n<li>Awareness:&nbsp;Humes raised within monastic traditions or communities that encourage mindfulness seem to shrug off many dangers more easily than other humes. They gain a +1 racial bonus on all saving throws and concentration checks. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat.</li>\n<li>Background Character:&nbsp;Humes who stay away from others are more adept at blending in or hiding away rather than fitting in. Humes with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Disguise, Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Stealth checks. This racial trait replaces integrated.</li>\n<li>Comprehensive Education:&nbsp;Humes raised with skilled teachers draw upon vast swathes of knowledge gained over centuries of civilization. They gain all Knowledge skills as class skills, and they gain a +1 racial bonus on all Knowledge skill checks. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Distanced:&nbsp;Some humes found out that curiosity killed the cat, and so aim to better protect themselves against the threats of the world. Humes gain a +4 racial bonus to Acrobatic checks made to move through threatened squares. This racial trait replaces curiosity.</li>\n<li>Dual Talent:&nbsp;Some humes are uniquely skilled at maximizing their natural gifts. These humes pick two ability scores and gain a +2 racial bonus in each of those scores. This racial trait replaces the +2 bonus to any one ability score, the bonus feat, and the skilled traits.</li>\n<li>Emissary:&nbsp;Some humes work to make others believe a single statement rather than improve relations. Once per day, humes may roll twice on a single Bluff or Diplomacy check and take the better roll. This racial trait replaces sociable.</li>\n<li>Eye for Talent:&nbsp;Humes have great intuition for hidden potential. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks. In addition, when they acquire an animal companion, bonded mount, cohort, or familiar, that creature gains a +2 bonus to one ability score of the character&rsquo;s choice. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Focused Study:&nbsp;All humes are skillful, but some, rather than being generalists, tend to specialize in a handful of skills. At 1st, 8th, and 16th level, such humes gain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/skill-focus-final/\">Skill Focus</a>&nbsp;in a skill of their choice as a bonus feat. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Frontier Survivor:&nbsp;Humes with this trait gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/technology-feats/technologist/\">Technologist</a>&nbsp;feat, which grants them understanding of technological subjects. Additionally, they gain a +2 racial bonus on Survival checks in the ruins of cities. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Fields:&nbsp;Humes born in rural areas are used to hard labor. They gain a racial bonus equal to half their character level to any one Craft or Profession skill, and once per day they may ignore an effect that would cause them to become fatigued or exhausted. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Mountains:&nbsp;Humes born in the mountains are skilled at negotiating heights and precipices. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks and Acrobatics checks to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. Furthermore, they are considered acclimated to the effects of high altitude. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Sea:&nbsp;Humes born near the sea are always drawn to it. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Profession (sailor) and Swim checks, and these are always class skills for them. They can hold their breath twice as long as normal, and spellcasters gain a +4 racial bonus on concentration checks when attempting to cast spells underwater. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Slums:&nbsp;Humes who eke out a life in a city&rsquo;s teeming slums must be quick and clever. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks, and a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks in urban and underground settings. In addition, they may roll twice when saving against disease, taking the better roll. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Snows:&nbsp;Humes born in chilly climes treat cold climates as one category less severe. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saving throws against the effects of cold climates, on any check or saving throw to avoid slipping and falling, and to CMD against trip combat maneuvers. This bonus applies on Acrobatics and Climb checks made in slippery conditions. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Streets:&nbsp;Humes from bustling cities are skilled with crowds. They gain a +1 racial bonus on Reflex saves and a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class when adjacent to at least two other allies. Crowds do not count as difficult terrain for them. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Sun:&nbsp;Humes born in tropical climates treat hot climates as one category less severe. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saving throws against the effects of a hot climate, as well as against the poison and distraction ability of swarms and vermin. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heart of the Wilderness:&nbsp;Humes raised in the wild learn the hard way that only the strong survive. They gain a racial bonus equal to half their character level on Survival checks. They also gain a +5 racial bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying and add half their character level to their Constitution score when determining the negative hit point total necessary to kill them. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Heroic:&nbsp;Some humes are born heroes. In campaigns that use the optional hero point system, each time these humes gain a level, they gain 2 hero points instead of 1. If they take the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/blood-of-heroes/\">Blood of Heroes</a>&nbsp;feat, they gain 3 hero points each level instead of 2. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Industrious:&nbsp;Humes are known for their drive and work ethic. Humes with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on concentration checks and checks with their choice of one Craft or Profession skill. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Innovative:&nbsp;Humes have come to shape the world because they are inveterate innovators. Humes with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks to independently research spells, create magic items they have never encountered before, and identify unique magical effects. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Charisma-based skill checks to persuade others to adopt a new ideology or further the cause of discovery and progress. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Institutional Memory:&nbsp;Humes rely on their institutions to remember the distant past and to preserve their own memories for the distant future. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Knowledge checks to answer questions about any organizations, guilds, or religions to which they belong, and they can attempt such skill checks untrained. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Military Tradition:&nbsp;Several hume cultures raise all children (or all children of a certain social class) to serve in the military or defend themselves with force of arms. They gain proficiency with up to two martial or exotic weapons appropriate to their culture. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Mixed Heritage:&nbsp;Often hume civilization is defined by more than one characteristic. A hume with this trait may select a second &ldquo;Heart of the&rdquo; racial trait. This replaces the bonus feat racial trait.</li>\n<li>One of the Multitude:&nbsp;City-dwelling humes are skilled at blending in with the busy multitudes of the city. They gain a +1 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks when within 10 feet of at least two other humanoids. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attacks of opportunity made while flanking. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Piety:&nbsp;Humes place great trust in the gods to protect them. Humes with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks and Knowledge (religion) is always a class skill for them. In addition, once per day before attempting an attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check, such a hume can call out to his deity in order to receive a +2 racial bonus on that roll; he can use this ability only if he is able to speak. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat racial trait.</li>\n<li>Practiced Hunter:&nbsp;Members of some hume cultures train from youth to find and follow the trails of vital game and at the same time hide the evidence of their own passage. These humes gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth and Survival checks, and Stealth and Survival are always class skills for them. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Silver Tongued:&nbsp;Humes are often adept at subtle manipulation and putting even sworn foes at ease. Humes with this trait gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks. In addition, when they use Diplomacy to shift a creature&rsquo;s attitude, they can shift up to three steps up rather than just two. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Social Ties:&nbsp;Some hume societies run on complex webs of favors and loyalties that canny members can intuitively exploit with relative ease. These humes gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks, and on any skill checks to recruit members and teams for an organization. They also add a +1 racial bonus to their Leadership scores (if they gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/leadership/\">Leadership</a>&nbsp;feat). This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n<li>Unstoppable Magic:&nbsp;Humes from civilizations built upon advanced magic are educated in a variety of ways to accomplish their magical goals. They gain a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks against spell resistance. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</li>\n<li>Wayfarer:&nbsp;Humes maintain the largest trade networks and the farthest-reaching civilizations, putting them in contact with a huge number of cultures. Humes with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, Knowledge (geography) checks, and Knowledge (local) checks. Whenever these humes gain a rank in Linguistics, they learn two languages rather than one. This racial trait replaces skilled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Hume Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many humes follow the general model of the standard hume, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 3 different potential heritages for hume PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a hume, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Ability:&nbsp;While most humes gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a different ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Hume Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-820\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Heritage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Ability Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Alternate Ability</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Cetra</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2 WIS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">Cetras gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (Arcana and History) skill checks and these two Knowledge skills are class skills.

Ronsos are humanoid in stature, standing above two meters in average height (with the males considerably larger and more muscular than the females, who possess a &ldquo;faster&rdquo;, more athletic body type). They are feline in appearance, possessing hands/claws and foot paws, they walk on (what would be for humes) the balls of their feet and possess dew-<wbr />claws as well as foot pads. Possessing lion-<wbr />like tails that roughly measure half of their body lengths, Ronso bodies are covered in blue fur (perhaps a trait due to their living in a winter climate) with patches of white (though the color has differed to either a darker blue or yellow depending on the individual) fur around the thighs, calves, shoulders, chest (males), tail-<wbr />tips, and scalp. The abundance of the fur the patches consist of seems to be greater on the males than the females, based on observation. The scalp fur, or mane, is usually tied back or styled in a similar way to hair. In regards to facial appearances, Ronsos differ in comparison to humes, again they possess feline attributes like muzzles and fangs as well as a distinct cat-<wbr />like nose. Their ears, while located similar to humans, possess a more elvaan shape and are thought to be capable of articulation similar to cats. The male Ronso possess a singular horn that grows from the forehead and denotes status and power. The females do not seem to have this attribute. For the males, the horn is a symbol of their strength and pride, and to lose the horn in battle is considered shameful. Both genders possess carnivore fangs, hinting that they may be meat eaters (it is unknown if they are omnivores). Their eyes are yellow, contrasting starkly against their fur, and constantly give the impression of a predator&rsquo;s gaze.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/ronso/\">View Ronso on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">11 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(12 &ndash; 15 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d4 years<br />(13 &ndash; 19 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+3d4 years<br />(14 &ndash; 23 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">21 years</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">32</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">45</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+3d10<br />(48 - 75 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">6 ft. 5 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+3d6 in.<br />(6 ft. 8 in. &ndash; 7 ft. 11 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">280 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(3d6x2 lbs.)<br />(286 &ndash; 316 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">6 ft. 0 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+3d6 in.<br />(6 ft. 3 in. &ndash; 7 ft. 6 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">225 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(3d6x2 lbs.)<br />(231 &ndash; 261 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Ronsos are strong and often wise, but gruff in demeanor.

As to be expected, the Al Bhed are skilled with technology, and are also skilled seamen and miners, willing to do almost anything to get their hands on &lsquo;new&rsquo; technology.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/al-bhed/\">View Al Bhed on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

The Ascian Emet-Selch, assuming the identity of a brilliant Legatus named Solus zos Galvus, brought about a technological revolution with the discovery of ceruleum. Solus established Garlemald as a world power within a single generation with himself as its emperor. He began a campaign of conquering other nations with his magitek forces, such as Doma, under the pretense of exterminating the practice of primal-summoning while presenting the other races as barbarians.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/garlean/\">View Garlean on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Viera gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks made in a forest environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magical Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Elemental Summoner:&nbsp;Choose one of the following elemental subtypes&mdash;earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, wind. When summoning a creature with the chosen subtype with a summon spell, increase the duration of that spell by 2 rounds. This choice is made at character creation, and can only be changed with retraining.</li>\n<li>Vieran Magic:&nbsp;Viera gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. In addition, they also receive a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties of magic items.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Weapon Familiarity:&nbsp;Viera are proficient with shortbows (including composite shortbows), longbows (including composite longbows), greatbows and orc hornbows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Viera can see twice as far as humes in conditions of dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fleet-<wbr />Footed:&nbsp;While all viera are naturally lithe and agile, some also are naturally speedy and have a strong desire to rush into situations rather than worrying about looking ahead. Viera with this racial trait receive Run as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Mist Sight:&nbsp;Some viera are very attuned to the mist, or sometimes the absence of the Mist. Viera with this racial trait can use one of the following spells (choose one) as an activated spell-like ability (the caster level is equal to the user&rsquo;s character level):&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-magic\">detect magic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-secret-doors/\">detect secret doors</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-undead\">detect undead</a>.&nbsp;This racial trait replaces vieran magic.</li>\n<li>Misty Mind:&nbsp;Some viera aren&rsquo;t interested in channeling magic outward, and instead have learned to use their natural connection to the Mist as a kind of shield. These viera gain a +2 racial bonus on Will saving throws to resist spells and spell-like abilities of the enfeebling (charm) and enfeebling (compulsion) subschools. In addition, if a viera fails such a save, it receives another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming the spell or spell-like ability has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the viera has a similar ability from another source, it can only use one of these abilities per round, but can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails. This racial trait replaces elemental summoner.</li>\n<li>Silent Hunter:&nbsp;Viera are renowned for their subtlety and skill. Viera with this racial trait reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving by 5 and can make Stealth checks while running at a &ndash;20 penalty (this number includes the penalty reduction from this racial trait). This racial trait replaces vieran immunities.</li>\n<li>Spirit of the Waters:&nbsp;Some viera have adapted to life in tune with the sea or along the reedy depths of wild rivers and lakes. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks, can always take 10 while swimming, and may choose Aquan as a bonus language. They are proficient with longspear, trident, and net. This racial trait replaces people of the wood and weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Urbanite:&nbsp;Viera who live in cities for more than a century can grow to know the ebb and flow of social situations just as their forest-<wbr />dwelling cousins know the rules of the wild. Viera with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks made to gather information and Sense Motive checks made to get a hunch about a social situation. This racial trait replaces people of the wood.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Viera Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many viera follow the general model of the standard viera, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 4 different potential heritages for viera PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a viera, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Skill Modifiers:&nbsp;While most viera gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a modifier to different skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Viera Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-656\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Heritage</th>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Ability Modifiers</th>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Alternate Skill Modifier</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fanow</td>\n<td>+2 DEX, +2 WIS, -2 STR</td>\n<td>Knowledge (History) and Stealth</td>\n<td>Natives to the Rak'Tika Greatwoods, and protectors of what remains of the Ronkan empire, these viera are rarely seen, quickly taking out any unwelcomed intruders to their lands.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Feol</td>\n<td>+2 DEX, +2 INT, -2 CON</td>\n<td>Knowledge (Local) and Knowledge (Engineering)</td>\n<td>Feol are the descendants of an aegyl leader who fell in love with a full-blooded viera, giving birth to the race that carries his name.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mist-Frenzied</td>\n<td>+2 STR, +2 CHA, -2 INT</td>\n<td>Knowledge (Arcana) and Intimidate</td>\n<td>Viera who have been exposed to too much Mist, they are stronger and more entuned to magic, but tend to attack anyone who may get in their way.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rava</td>\n<td>+2 DEX, +2 CHA, -2 CON</td>\n<td>Knowledge (Planes) and Handle Animal</td>\n<td>The Rava Viera in Golmore Jungle live under a strict code, the \"Green Word\", that forbid them from interacting with the outside world unless strictly necessary.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Racial Feats</h2>\n<p>The following feats are available to a viera character who meets the prerequisites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/attuned-to-the-wild-viera\">Attuned to the Wild</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/guardian-of-the-wild-viera\">Guardian of the Wild</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/leaf-singer-viera\">Leaf Singer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/light-step-viera\">Light Step</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/mage-of-the-wild-viera\">Mage of the Wild</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/natural-instinct-viera\">Natural Instinct</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/one-with-wood-mandragora-viera\">One with Wood</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/spirit-of-the-wild-viera\">Spirit of the Wild</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/stabbing-shot-viera\">Stabbing Shot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/vieran-accuracy-viera\">Vieran Accuracy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to vieras:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/thief/archetypes/deadly-courtesan/\">Deadly Courtesan</a>&nbsp;(Thief; Viera)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/monk/archetypes/treetop-monk/\">Treetop Monk</a>&nbsp;(Monk; Viera)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/beastmaster/archetypes/wild-shadow/\">Wild Shadow</a>&nbsp;(Beastmaster; Viera)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/ninja/archetypes/woodland-stalker/\">Woodland Stalker</a>&nbsp;(Ninja; Viera)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/\">Archer</a>:&nbsp;Add +1/2 on critical hit confirmation rolls for attacks made with bows or crossbows (maximum bonus of +4).

Whether or not the attempt succeeds, the winds are exhausted and no longer provide a bonus to the sylph&rsquo;s AC for 24 hours. This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces quick reactions.</li>\n<li>Flight:&nbsp;You only ever see a sylph flying around and never on their twig-like feet (unless mortally wounded). Sylphs gain an additional 20 foot of flight speed. In addition, their maneuverability improves by two steps. This racial trait replaces camouflage, curiosity, and quick reactions.</li>\n<li>Storm in the Blood:&nbsp;A sylph with this racial trait gains fast healing 2 for 1 round anytime she takes lightning damage (whether or not this lightning damage gets through her lightning resistance). The sylph can heal up to 2 hit points per level per day with this ability, after which it ceases to function. This racial trait replaces quick reactions.</li>\n<li>Tempered:&nbsp;Those who are followers of their false God gain 5 wind resistance. This racial trait replaces quick reactions.</li>\n<li>Whispering Wind:&nbsp;Some sylphs are especially thin and wispy, as though they were made more of air than flesh. Sylphs with this racial trait gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.

Before the Great War, they adamantly refused invitations by the Shadow Lord to join the beastmen armies&ndash;until he convinced them that the steamships of Bastok would eventually destroy their environment. During the war, the sahagins used their sea maneuvering abilities to attack even the strongest ships in the allied fleet, and were feared by all seafaring soldiers.

Varg&rsquo;s natural attacks count as silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction, and a varg may spend a standard action and touch a lycanthrope to give that lycanthrope an insight bonus equal to the half the varg&rsquo;s level plus his Wisdom modifier (minimum +1) to the target&rsquo;s check to change back to human form.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keen Senses:&nbsp;Vargs receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li>\n<li>Wolf Empathy:&nbsp;Vargs receive a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal and Diplomacy checks when dealing with wolves, dire wolves, or any other wolf subtype.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bite:&nbsp;Vargs gain a natural bite attack, dealing 1d4 points of damage.

They receive a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty on Diplomacy checks when dealing with other races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Civilized:&nbsp;Outcast vargs have learned to better integrate with society in an attempt to find a new pack. Vargs with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Cold Acclimated:&nbsp;Vargs are accustomed to the extreme temperatures of snowy and polar regions to the far north. Vargs with this racial trait have white fur and are immune to environmental damage from cold weather (below 40 degrees). In conditions of extreme cold (below 0 degrees), vargs suffer the normal conditions for cold weather, not the harsher conditions for extreme cold. In addition, vargs with this racial trait also gain Ice Resistance 5. This racial trait replaces the natural armor trait.</li>\n<li>Feral:&nbsp;Vargs with this trait give in to their animal natures at the expense of their intellects. A varg with this racial trait always has Perception and Stealth as class skills. In return for this racial trait, the varg starts with a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty to Intelligence.</li>\n<li>Heat Acclimated:&nbsp;Vargs are accustomed to the extreme temperatures of the plains and deserts they inhabit. Vargs with this racial trait automatically succeed on Fortitude saves to avoid heat dangers for conditions up to and including severe heat. This racial trait replaces the natural armor racial trait.</li>\n<li>Information Hunter:&nbsp;Outcast vargs who live in large settlements have learned to apply their hunting and scavenging instincts to more esoteric pursuits. Vargs with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and Knowledge (local) is always a class skill for them. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Light Build:&nbsp;Some vargs are light and proportionately weaker but more agile. These vargs start with a +2 bonus to Dexterity. This racial trait replaces the +2 Strength bonus.</li>\n<li>Influential:&nbsp;Exceptionally clever vargs take up the mantle of shaman for their tribes and use their gifts to more readily enslave varg captives. Vargs with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks and add +1 to the saving throw DCs for their spells of the enfeebling school that they cast. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Loper:&nbsp;Vargs find success by moving faster than their kin, sometimes at the expense of the thick fur protecting them. Vargs with this racial trait gain a +10 bonus to their base speed, and they gain an additional +10 foot racial bonus when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions. This racial trait replaces the natural armor racial trait.</li>\n<li>Midnight Child:&nbsp;Vargs are acclimated to the night so much that they are adept at dodging blows whilst hiding within it. Whenever a varg has concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of attacks against them increases by 5%. This racial trait replaces fearless.</li>\n<li>Midnight Eyes:&nbsp;Vargs are sometimes born with an extraordinary ability to see at night that far exceeds that of the average member of their race. Vargs gain darkvision that allows them to see in the dark up to 120 feet. This racial trait replaces darkvision and scent.</li>\n<li>Savant:&nbsp;One out of every thousand varg births results in a hairless varg, which the varg tribe deems as a great portent for the tribe&rsquo;s success. Vargs with this racial trait start with +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, and &ndash;<wbr />2 Constitution, and they have a +1 racial bonus on all saving throws. This racial trait replaces the starting attribute bonuses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Varg Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many vargs follow the general model of the varg, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 2 different potential heritages for varg PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a varg, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Empathy:&nbsp;While most varg gain a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal and Diplomacy checks when dealing with wolves, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a different empathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Varg Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-814\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Heritages</th>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Ability Modifiers</th>\n<th style=\"width: 15%;\">Alternate Empathy</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnoll</td>\n<td>+2 STR, +2 INT, -2 CHA</td>\n<td>Hyenas</td>\n<td>Gnolls are a race of hulking, humanoids that resemble hyenas in more than mere appearance; they show a striking affinity with the scavenging animals, to the point of keeping them as pets, and reflect many of the lesser creatures&rsquo; behaviors.

Tall and thinly built, with long limbs, large hands with prominent fingernails, and narrow, angular faces. Their skin is pale and somewhat translucent, and their features are often framed by a collection of thin blue veins that pulse underneath their skin. They have soft, melodious voices and are disinclined to be harsh. They are known for their brightly colored and wildly styled hair, often floral or tree-like. They are a somber and astute people, inclined towards traditionalism. Guados are most known for their connections to the forces of death and their links to the afterlife, often tasking themselves with protecting places with strong ties to other realms and planes of existence, especially those where souls are confirmed to reside after their death. Guados take well to the life of the faithful, and are often found as priests in places where they are not known to commonly reside, performing embalming services, funeral rites, and other rituals associated with death. However, their association with death has a habit of making them a bit alien or unnerving to other races, and Guados, as a result, tend to form their own communities outside of the settlements of other races, rather than intermingle freely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/guado/\">View Guado on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

They gain +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, and -2 Constitution.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Guados are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Guados are Humanoids with the guado subtype.</li>\n<li>Base Speed:&nbsp;Guados have a base speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Guados begin play speaking Common and Guado. Guados with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following for their bonus languages: Al Bhed, Draconic, Elvaan, Lalafell, Numish, Ronsaur, or Vieran.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deathless Spirit:&nbsp;Guados are creatures that are attuned to the bridges between life and death, being sensitive to their ebbs and flows, yet resistant to their negative effects. Being living creatures, the forces of death and undeath have less sway over them than other mortals. They gain Shadow Resistance 5. In addition, they do not lose hit points when they gain a negative level, and they gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and spells or spell-like abilities of the necromancy or dark spell varieties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Skill Bonuses:&nbsp;Being associated with the powers of life and death makes one hard to read, and by extension hard to fool. This is only further exacerbated by the sometimes lyrical, poetic, or unsettling ways guados tend to speak. Guados gain a +2 racial bonus to Bluff and Sense Motive skills.</li>\n<li>Skill Training:&nbsp;Knowledge of the ways of life and death, bridges between the two, and the aspects of undeath are core to the beliefs and the traditions of the guado. Guados always treat Knowledge (Planes) and Knowledge (Religion) as class skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magical Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect Undead (Sp):&nbsp;Once per day, a guado can cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/detect-undead\">detect undead</a>&nbsp;as a spell-<wbr />like ability (caster level equal to the guado&rsquo;s class level).</li>\n<li>Elemental Summoner:&nbsp;Choose one of the following elemental subtypes&mdash;earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, wind. When summoning a creature with the chosen subtype with a summon spell, increase the duration of that spell by 2 rounds. This choice is made at character creation, and can only be changed with retraining.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Movement Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Moderate Fleetness:&nbsp;Guados&rsquo; long limbs allow them to walk and run faster than what others expect of them, but their slender frames only make these advantages go so far. So long as a guado has no more than a medium load, and is not fatigued, exhausted, or suffering any ability damage to its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, its base land speed is increased by 5 feet. Guados who have attained a Swim speed may apply this bonus to it as well, but not to any Climb, Fly, or Burrow speeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carrion Sense:&nbsp;Some guados are more attuned to deathlike energies than others of their kind, having the disturbing ability to track creatures by the scent of their lifeblood. This functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities/#TOC-Scent\">scent</a>&nbsp;ability, but only for corpses and badly wounded creatures (creatures with 25% or fewer hit points). This racial trait replaces skill training.</li>\n<li>Deep Magic:&nbsp;Guados tend to live underground when they can, as a means to remain undisturbed, and also as most gates to other planes of existence are found in underground locations, accessed through caves. Particularly rude or unscrupulous non-guados will often make the snide connection between this habit and the practice of burial. Guados with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance and a +2 racial bonus when dispelling magic. This racial trait replaces deathless spirit.</li>\n<li>Fast Movement:&nbsp;Some guados, especially those of a more athletic bend, have refined their longer stride to boost their speed even further. Guados with this racial trait increase their base land speed by 10 feet. This racial trait replaces moderate fleetness, and skill bonuses.</li>\n<li>Unsent Summoner: Guados who are so in touch with the afterlife learn more advanced techniques to control or create them. When casting spells to summon or create undead, guados treat their caster level as if it were 2 higher, this does not give them earlier access to spells. This racial trait replaces elemental summoner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to guados:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/cleric/archetypes/exorcist/\">Exorcist</a>&nbsp;(Cleric; Guado)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/astrologian/\">Astrologian</a>:&nbsp;The astrologian gains +1/6th of an astrology secret.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/black-mage/\">Black Mage</a>:&nbsp;The black mage gains +1/6th of a mage talent.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/cleric/\">Cleric</a>:&nbsp;The cleric inflicts or restores +1 damage/hit point on undead targets when using channel energy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/dark-knight/\">Dark Knight</a>:&nbsp;The dark knight restores +1 hit point on undead targets when using harm touch.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/holy-knight/\">Holy Knight</a>:&nbsp;The holy knight inflicts +1 damage to undead creatures when using lay on hands.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/illusionist/\">Illusionist</a>:&nbsp;The illusionist gains +1/6th of a veil power.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/necromancer/\">Necromancer</a>:&nbsp;The necromancer restores +1 hit point on undead targets when using harm touch.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/scholar/\">Scholar</a>:&nbsp;The scholar gains +1/6th of a scholar exploit.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/summoner/\">Summoner</a>:&nbsp;Reduce damage dealt to summoner as a result of life link by 1.

Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gobby Skill Bonus:&nbsp;Goblins are very good at crafting magical and cursed items and gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft skill checks. This racial trait replaces goblin&rsquo;s unique handle on things.</li>\n<li>Greedilox:&nbsp;Like qiqirn, goblins are very greedy and gain a +2 bonus on Appraise and a +2 Diplomacy (for selling) checks to determine the price of non-magical goods that contain precious metals or gemstones. They will often appraise it higher to get a better selling price of +5%. This racial trait replaces craftsman.</li>\n<li>Hardy:&nbsp;Not everyone tests the poisons they use, but goblins do. After several applications, they start to build resistances against certain poisons and gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. This racial trait replaces silver tongued.</li>\n<li>Hobgoblinoid:&nbsp;Hobgoblins are stronger than their normal gobbo cousins, as well as more charismatic, but less intelligent. They gain +2 Strength, +2 Charisma, and -2 Intelligence. Hobgoblins are medium creatures, however. This racial trait modifies the base Goblin&rsquo;s ability score, and size.</li>\n<li>Pyromaniac:&nbsp;Goblins love to burn and are treated as +1 level higher when casting spells with the fire descriptor and determining the damage of chemist bombs that deal fire damage. This trait does not give goblins early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that they could already use without this trait. If a goblin has a Charisma score of 11 or higher, it also gains the following spell-like abilities (the caster level is equal to the goblin&rsquo;s character level): 1/day&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/b/burst-of-light/\">burst of light</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/dancing-lights/\">dancing lights</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/i/ignite/\">ignite</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/t/torchlight/\">torchlight</a>.

This racial trait replaces master tinkerer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Goblin Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many goblins follow the general model of the standard goblin, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 2 different potential heritages for goblin PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a goblin, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Skill Modifiers:&nbsp;While most&nbsp;goblins gain a +2 racial bonus on&nbsp;Bluff&nbsp;and&nbsp;Diplomacy&nbsp;checks, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a modifier to different skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Goblin Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-778\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Heritage</th>\n<th>Ability Modifiers</th>\n<th>Alternate Skill Modifier</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Moblin</td>\n<td>+2 DEX, +2 INT, -2 WIS</td>\n<td>Knowledge (Engineering) and Craft (Alchemy)</td>\n<td>The moblins are a tribe of goblins, Moblins banded together in a mob to dig the tunnels of Movalpolos (mostly be means of enslaving other races to do so).

They are also skillful merchants, their cheerful disposition often charming potential customers. Moogles typically get no taller than 3 to 4 feet. They tend to have small eyes (like moles) and black, red, or purple bat-<wbr />like wings. Their most distinguishing feature is a single black antenna that sticks up from the head with a small, usually red, ball (or &ldquo;pompom&rdquo;) at the end. Their ears are usually shaped like a cat&rsquo;s, but sometimes they have longer rabbit-<wbr />like ears. Most Moogles have white or pink fur. When speaking hume languages, they tend to end their sentences with the sound &lsquo;kupo&rsquo;. Moogles are mostly found in large cities, working as engineers, or serving aboard airships. They are avid storytellers and holders of many superstitions.

They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, and &ndash;2 Strength.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Moogles are Humanoid creatures with the moogle subtype.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Moogles are Small creatures and thus gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a &ndash;1 penalty to their Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.</li>\n<li>Base Speed:&nbsp;Moogles have a base speed of 20 feet on land. While moogle wings are too small to provide true flight, lingering remnants of their fey heritage allow moogles to achieve limited flight for short periods of time while wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. A moogle can fly with clumsy maneuverability a number of rounds at a time equal to his Constitution bonus. A moogle can attempt to fly for longer durations by making Constitution check each additional round of flight (DC 10 + 2 per extra round). A moogle&rsquo;s natural fly speed is equal to his base land speed. After flying, a moogle must rest a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent flying before flying again. Additionally, a moogle gains +4 on Acrobatics checks as long as he is able to fly.</li>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Moogles begin play speaking Common and Moogle. Moogles with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Auran, Draconic, Goblin, Numish, and Sylvan. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Defensive Training:&nbsp;Moogles gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC against monsters of the giant subtype.</li>\n<li>Eternal Hope:&nbsp;Moogles rarely lose hope and are always confident that even hopeless situations will work out. Moogles receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against fear and despair effects. Additionally, once per day, after rolling a 1 on a d20, the moogle may reroll and use the second result.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emissary:&nbsp;Once per day, moogles can roll twice when making a Bluff or Diplomacy check and take the better roll.</li>\n<li>Good Merchant:&nbsp;Moogles seem to have the innate ability to identify the value of items and sell them at a good margin. Moogles receive a +2 racial bonus on all Appraise checks. Furthermore, moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on all Diplomacy checks concerning any type of business transaction.</li>\n<li>Handy:&nbsp;Moogles receive a +2 racial bonus on a Craft or Profession skill of their choice.</li>\n<li>Keen Senses:&nbsp;Moogles receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li>\n<li>Scavenger:&nbsp;Moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise and Perception checks to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine whether food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Construct Familiarity:&nbsp;Moogles get a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against constructs and receive a +4 dodge bonus to AC against them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Moogles can see twice as far as humes in conditions of dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hydrophobia:&nbsp;When drenched in water or some other liquid, a moogle receives a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty on attack rolls and concentration checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Academician:&nbsp;Some moogles are more academically inclined than their kin. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any single Knowledge skill. This racial trait replaces good merchant.</li>\n<li>Attentive:&nbsp;Moogles with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks. This bonus increases to +4 to notice when someone is enchanted or possessed. This racial trait replaces handy.</li>\n<li>Darkvision:&nbsp;Some moogle strains have lived in the underground depths for so long they have given up on light entirely and gained darkvision with a range of 60 feet. This racial trait replaces low-<wbr />light vision and keen senses.</li>\n<li>Engineer:&nbsp;Moogle engineers tinker endlessly with fire, explosives, and the engines of war. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) and Knowledge (engineering) checks. This racial trait replaces good merchant.</li>\n<li>Explorer:&nbsp;Many moogles are obsessed with seeing as much of the world as possible, rather than perfecting some specific talent or vocation. These moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks and checks for one Knowledge skill of their choice. This racial trait replaces construct familiarity and good merchant.</li>\n<li>Gift of Tongues:&nbsp;Moogles love languages and learning about those they meet. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks, and they learn one additional language every time they put a rank in the Linguistics skill. This racial trait replaces defensive training and handy.</li>\n<li>Grounded:&nbsp;Some moogles lack their innate ability to fly. Not being ones to give up, they let nothing stop them! These moogles still move at speed of 20 ft, but are no longer slowed down by encumberance, medium/heavy armor and similar effects. They also gain +1 racial bonus on saves against effects that would reduce their movement speed. This racial trait modifies their&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">base</span>&nbsp;speed.</li>\n<li>Knack with Poison:&nbsp;Some moogles have an instinctive understanding of poisons and their uses. Moogles gain a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to make poison. The bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poisons increases to +4 if the moogle accidentally poisons himself when applying or readying the substance. This racial trait replaces construct familiarity and good merchant.</li>\n<li>Kupo-Recovery:&nbsp;For some moogles, the promise of a kupo-nut is enough to push them beyond their normal limits. If a moogle with this racial trait is dying, and a creature gives it a taste of a kupo-nut (a standard action for an adjacent creature), it immediately stabilizes. This racial trait replaces handy.</li>\n<li>Low Blow:&nbsp;Some moogles train extensively in the art of attacking larger creatures. Moogles with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on critical confirmation rolls against opponents larger than themselves. This racial trait replaces handy.</li>\n<li>Master Tinker:&nbsp;Moogles experiment with all manner of mechanical devices.

Here are 5 different potential heritages for m<span lang=\"en-US\">oogle</span>&nbsp;PCs.

Their settlements lay beneath the waves, where they thrive on the endless bounties of the deep.

Perhaps in part due to this conviction, they have a penchant for trading and collecting all manner of effects.</p>\n<p>The Kojin are skilled traders who welcome dealings with other races. They are most comfortable in the water, having settlements under the sea. They believe that unique gods reside in all things, and collect and hoard rare items that house powerful Kami to bring power and prosperity to themselves and their kin.</p>\n<p>After the Garlean Empire invaded, the Kojin split into two factions: the pacifist Kojin of the Blue, and the mercenary Kojin of the Red. The Red Kojin allied with the Empire as mercenaries, concealing their faith and practicing it in secret. The Blue Kojin would rather be peaceful traders, and so minimize their involvement in Imperial affairs. The Blue Kojin see the Red practicing their faith in secret to be a mockery that the Kami would not approve of.</p>\n<p>It is unclear why the Blue Kojin are green, while the Red Kojin are red.

They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Hypellos are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Hypellos are Humanoid creatures with a hypello subtype.</li>\n<li>Base Speed:&nbsp;Hypellos have a base speed of 20 feet, but their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. Though due to their life near and within water, they have a swim speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Hypellos begin play speaking Common and Hypello. Hypellos with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Moogle, Goblin, Sylvan, Dwarven. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Camouflage:&nbsp;Hypellos receive a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks in marshes and forested areas.</li>\n<li>Hardy:&nbsp;Hypellos gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, spells, and spell-like abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Amphibians:&nbsp;Hypellos begin with the Amphibious racial trait, allowing them to breathe both air and water.</li>\n<li>Animal Empathy:&nbsp;Hypellos gain a +2 to all Handle Animal checks made to influence animals.</li>\n<li>Rider:&nbsp;Hypellos gain a +2 on Ride checks.</li>\n<li>Ride ze Shoopuf?:&nbsp;Hypellos treat Handle Animal and Ride as class skills.</li>\n<li>Swim:&nbsp;Hypellos have a swim speed of 30 feet and gain the +8 racial bonus on swim checks that a swim speed normally grants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Movement Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Swamp Stride:&nbsp;A hypello can move through difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a hypello normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Darkvision:&nbsp;Hypellos can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor Communication:&nbsp;Due to their vocal patterns and childish demeanor, hypellos gain a -2 to Diplomacy and Intimidation checks against all other races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defensive Training:&nbsp;Hypellos often live in close proximity to very large animals and dangerous creatures they must learn to avoid in order to survive. They gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against Large or larger animals and magical beasts. This racial trait replaces swamp stride.</li>\n<li>Fishy Merchant:&nbsp;Hypellos who put themselves up as tradesmen do surprisingly well, regardless of their speech. Hypellos with this racial trait gain a racial bonus of +2 to Bluff and Diplomacy checks, as well as ignoring their Poor Communication trait, when engaging in a trade. This racial trait replaces animal empathy and rider.</li>\n<li>Glider:&nbsp;Hypellos&rsquo; aerodynamic bodies and thick webbing between the toes enable a falling hypello to treat the distance fallen as half the actual distance. The hypello can steer himself while falling, moving horizontally up to a number of feet equal to half the vertical distance fallen. The hypello cannot use this trait if it is wearing heavy armor, is carrying a heavy load, or is unable to react to the fall (such as being helpless). This racial trait replaces swamp stride.</li>\n<li>Land Lubber:&nbsp;Some hypellos stay away from the waters, taking to the sky in airships or settling in towns, as such their legs are stronger than others in exchange of their swimming ability. Hypellos with this racial trait increase their base speed to 30 feet. This racial trait replaces swim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to hypellos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/archetypes/yabbleshammy-archer/'\">Yabbleshammy Archer</a>&nbsp;(Archer; Hypello)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/\">Archer</a>:&nbsp;Add +1 foot to the range increment with bows or crossbows.

This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Day Raider:</span><span lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;Some gnaths are born with a greater tolerance for sunlight. They lose light sensitivity and have low-light vision instead of darkvision. This racial trait replaces light sensitivity and darkvision.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Echo Whistler:</span><span lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;By observing the noises in underground tunnels, gnaths learn to uncannily mimic any voice or sound they have heard. Three times per day, gnaths with this trait can attempt to trick someone in this way by making a Bluff check against the listener&rsquo;s Sense Motive check. Gnaths with this trait get a +2 circumstance bonus on this check if they&rsquo;re in tunnels or other structures where their voice can echo. This racial trait replaces crafty.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Improved Exoskeleton:</span><span lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;Some gnaths are born with stronger exoskeletons and can take more physical abuse, they gain a +2 natural armor bonus. By taking this trait, the gnath&rsquo;s exoskeleton is so thick that armor becomes difficult to wear and you have to add +50% to the cost of any armor you buy or build. This racial trait replaces exoskeleton.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Swarming:</span><span lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;Gnaths are used to living and fighting communally with other gnaths. Therefore, when ordered to go for food, they will go in massive armies and swam anyone and everyone, peeling flesh off of their bodies in order to bring it back for their leaders. Gnaths can occupy the same space as one other Small ally without penalty. If a gnath shares a space with another gnath who has this trait, each gnath gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, as they help jostle one another out of the way of incoming attacks. Gnaths also gain a +1 racial bonus on aid another rolls. This racial trait replaces crafty.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Tempered:</span><span lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;Those who are followers of their false God gain 5 Elemental Resistance (Earth).

{"_id":"dgJEKQnIsQU4pmkK","name":"Aegyl","permission":{"default":0,"e1nAgjLmIKiSwmCp":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The aegyl resemble humes, except they have large feathery wings on their back. These wings can come in different colors, from brown to red to black. These wings allow the aegyl to fly with no problems. However, the strain they put on their body means they have the shortest life span of any race in Ivalice, only living for forty years. All aegyl are cold and aloof. They are either incapable at showing emotions, or do not feel them at all. The aegyl are not too keen on other races, since most of the Sky Pirates who arrived either attacked or enslaved them. Aegyl make their home in many stone edifices erected over several of Lemur&eacute;s&rsquo;s continents. These homes were built by the first generation of aegyl to reach Lemur&eacute;s following their banishment by the Occuria. Successive generations have elected to inhabit these century-<wbr />old dwellings rather than construct new ones, an effort made easier by the small aegyl population. According to the Folio, aegyl are mostly vegetarians, the majority of their diet being wild fruits and vegetables. The Damson, a plump red fruit that grows in the Bosco Pampa, appears to be their favorite. Aegyl harvest the waters of Lemur&eacute;s for native fish, and eggs are also a part of their cuisine. However, other hunting sources are nonexistent, as the Yarhi beasts that would normally yield meat are but illusions, and fade to nothing when killed. Since the climate of Lemur&eacute;s is mostly tropical, aegyl garb is light and geared for flight. Indeed, most aegyl males do not wear an upper garment, and aegyl armor is likewise sparsely distributed over the aegyl form. As Llyud exemplifies, aegyl jewelry is simplistic, being of lightweight gold and lacking in inlaid jewels. This absence of exquisite garments is yet another indication of aegyl humility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/aegyl/\">View Aegyl on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">12 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(13 &ndash; 16 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(13 &ndash; 18 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d4 years<br />(14 &ndash; 20 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">20 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">27</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">35</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">+2d4<br />(37 - 43 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 10 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d10 in.<br />(5 ft. &ndash; 6 ft. 6 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">120 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d10x4 lbs.)<br />(128 &ndash; 200 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 5 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d10 in.<br />(4 ft. 7 in. &ndash; 6 ft. 1 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">85 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d10x4 lbs.)<br />(93 &ndash; 165 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Aegyls are very agile and possess an aptitude for tactics, but have a weaker bone structure than other humanoids and are very cold and aloof. They gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, &ndash;<wbr />2 Constitution and &ndash;<wbr />2 Charisma.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Aegyls are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Aegyls are Humanoid creatures with the aegyl subtype.</li>\n<li>Base Speed:&nbsp;Aegyls have a base speed of 30 feet on land. They also have a fly speed of 50 feet (average), as long as they do not carry more than a Medium load, are not wearing heavy armor, and are not fatigued or exhausted. If aegyls carry a heavy load or wear heavy armor, their flight speed drops to 30 feet with poor maneuverability (-<wbr />4 penalty on Fly checks). An aegyl&rsquo;s wing span is typically 12 feet, and cannot fly in an area that does not allow them to fully extend their wings.</li>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Aegyls begin play speaking Common and Aegyllan. Aegyl with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Draconic, Dwarven, Elvaan, Galkan, Giant, Goblin, and Orc. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Elemental Resistance:&nbsp;Aegyls have wind&nbsp;and lightning&nbsp;elemental resistance 5.</li>\n<li>Eternal Hope:&nbsp;Aegyls gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against fear and despair effects. Also, once per day, after a natural roll of 1 on a d20 roll, aegyls may reroll and use the second result.</li>\n<li>Illusion Resistance:&nbsp;Aegyls gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusion spells or effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keen Senses:&nbsp;Aegyls receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;An aegyl can see twice as far as a hume in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotionless:&nbsp;Aegyls are cold and aloof. They do not like dealing with other races other than their own. They receive a &ndash;<wbr />2 penalty on Diplomacy checks when dealing with other races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oppressive:&nbsp;Aegyls often have a natural talent for sensing how to unsettle and oppress other creatures. As a swift action, an aegyl can attempt a Sense Motive check against a DC of 10 + a creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier or a DC of 10 + the creature&rsquo;s Bluff modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, the aegyl gains a +4 racial bonus on Intimidate checks against that target and a +1 racial bonus to the DC of any fear effects she uses against that target. This racial trait replaces keen senses and emotionless.</li>\n<li>Weather Savvy:&nbsp;Some aegyls are so in tune with the air and sky that they can sense the slightest change in atmospheric conditions. Aegyls with this trait can spend a full-<wbr />round action to predict the weather in an area for the next 24 hours. The aegyl&rsquo;s prediction is always accurate, but cannot account for spells or supernatural effects that might alter the forecast. This racial trait replaces the aegyl&rsquo;s keen senses racial trait.</li>\n<li>Wing-<wbr />Clipped:&nbsp;The flight of wing-<wbr />clipped aegyl is weaker than normal, whether from deformity or injury.

Closer inspection reveals a few key differences, however. Burmecians&rsquo; teeth are sharp, but lack the elongated incisors so typical of most rodents; their skin is smooth and almost entirely hairless, and tends to be gray or brown in coloration. Though they retain the sensitive snouts of their ancestors, burmecians do not sport whiskers; their ears are large and upraised, giving them a certain rabbit-<wbr />like air. In combat, they are more likely to rely on their hearing than their relatively weak eyesight, a fact that gives them an edge in dark and confined quarters. Unusual too are their double-<wbr />jointed legs and wide feet, both of which are capable of absorbing tremendous kinetic energy; with training, burmecians can leap distances nearly three to four times higher and wider than their human counterparts and survive substantial drops with almost no ill effects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/burmecian/\">View Burmecian on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Battle-<wbr />Hardened:&nbsp;Incessant drills make defense second nature to all burmecians.

The claws are a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the burmecian is wielding manufactured weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleyran Ancestry:&nbsp;Sickened by the Burmecians&rsquo; dedication to war, a separatist group left the Realm of Eternal Rain and founded a new city in a giant tree to the west. When burmecians with this racial trait successfully use Diplomacy to win over an individual, that creature takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attempts to resist any of the member&rsquo;s Charisma-based skills for the next 24 hours. In addition, burmecians with this racial trait gain a +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, and -2 Strength. This racial trait replaces fearless and the starting burmecian ability score traits.</li>\n<li>Cornered Fury:&nbsp;Burmecians can fight viciously when cut off from friends and allies. Whenever a burmecian is reduced to half or fewer of his hit points, and has no conscious ally within 30 feet, he gains a +2 racial bonus on melee attack rolls and to Armor Class. This racial trait replaces battle-hardened and quick reactions.</li>\n<li>Disease Immunity:&nbsp;Some burmecians are immune to non-magical diseases. If a burmecian with this racial trait loses a saving throw against disease, he becomes a carrier and can transmit the disease through his claws for 1 week. This racial trait replaces battle-hardened and fearless.</li>\n<li>Market Dweller:&nbsp;Some burmecians are practiced at taking advantage of foes. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Sense Motive, and Sleight of Hand checks. This racial trait replaces keen senses and natural jumper.</li>\n<li>Rodent Empathy:&nbsp;Some burmecians are able to control rodents and gain a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks made to influence rodents. This racial trait replaces natural jumper.</li>\n<li>Scent:&nbsp;Some burmecians have much more strongly developed senses of smell, instead of keen eyes and ears. These burmecians have the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">scent</a>&nbsp;ability, but take a &ndash;2 penalty on all Perception checks based primarily on sight or hearing. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n<li>Skulk:&nbsp;Some burmecians can blend easily into their environments, and move with surprising grace. Burmecians gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks, and take only a &ndash;5 penalty on Stealth checks made to hide from creatures they have distracted with a Bluff check (rather than the normal &ndash;10 penalty). This racial trait replaces natural jumper.</li>\n<li>Unnatural:&nbsp;Some burmecians unnerve normal animals, and train to defend themselves against the inevitable attacks from such creatures. These burmecians take a &ndash;4 penalty on all Charisma-<wbr />based skill checks to affect creatures of the animal type, and receive a +2 dodge bonus to AC against animals. An animal&rsquo;s starting attitude toward burmecians is one step worse than normal.

Having formed two incredibly fearless orders of knights, the elvaans subjugated just about the whole of the Quon continent. They destroyed beastmen strongholds, and tarutaru villages were no match for the San d&rsquo;ria knights anyhow. Sadly for them, the flood of victories came to an end when the hume and the galka of Bastok combined their strength and technology against them in the second battle of Konschtat. Defeated, the proud Elvaan kingdom was unable to bear the humiliation in peace. The result was internal turmoil and civil war. Gradually, the conquered lands slipped away from their rule as well, and the elvaans retreated to San d&rsquo;ria. A strong sense of faith and pride means that the elvaans are essentially an aristocratic race. The elvaan trait of firm belief makes them admirable models of faith. Not only do they stay clear of questionable activities, they take great pride in their race as well. Both male and female elvaans are known to be swordsmen of the highest order because of their strength of mind and vitality. Close to the hume in their looks, the elvaans usually shun the world of commerce preferring to live by the sword.

See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fearless:&nbsp;Elvaans gain a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws against fear effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keen Senses:&nbsp;Elvaans receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li>\n<li>Martial Background:&nbsp;Elvaans receives the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat-final/\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feat for free at first level, and may apply it to any single weapon he is proficient in.</li>\n<li>Noble Upbringing:&nbsp;Elvaans take great pride in their history, culture, and government. They receive a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nobility) and Knowledge (history) checks and treat these skills as class skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gatecrasher:&nbsp;Elvaans gain a +2 racial bonus on Strength checks to break objects and a +2 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder.</li>\n<li>Hatred:&nbsp;Elvaans receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the orc and goblin subtypes due to special training against these hated foes.</li>\n<li>Weapon Familiarity:&nbsp;Elvaans are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, and shortbows (including composite shortbows).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />light Vision:&nbsp;An elvaan can see twice as far as a hume in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcane Focus:&nbsp;Some elvaan families have such long traditions of producing mages (and other spellcasters) that they raise their children with the assumption each is destined to be a powerful magic-user, with little need for mundane concerns such as skill with weapons. Elvaans with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on concentration checks made to cast spells defensively. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Darkvision:&nbsp;Though uncommon, some groups of elvaans are born with darkvision, rather than low-<wbr />light vision. Elvaans with this racial trait gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet, but also gain sensitivity to light and are dazzled in areas of bright light or within the radius of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/daylight/\">daylight</a>&nbsp;spell. This racial trait replaces low-<wbr />light vision.</li>\n<li>Desert Runner:&nbsp;Some elvaans thrive in the deepest deserts, forever roaming across burned and parched lands. Elvaans with this racial trait receive a +4 racial bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves to avoid fatigue, exhaustion, or ill effects from running, forced marches, starvation, thirst, or hot or cold environments. This racial trait replaces noble upbringing.</li>\n<li>Elemental Resistance:&nbsp;Elvaans who dwell in the most extreme environments, from arctic wastelands to volcanic plains, develop natural resistance to the dangers of their homelands over the course of a few generations. Elvaans with this racial trait gain elemental resistance 5 to earth, fire, ice, lighting, water, or wind. This choice is made at character creation, and once made it cannot be changed. This racial trait replaces martial background.</li>\n<li>Fleet-<wbr />Footed:&nbsp;While all elvaans are naturally lithe and agile, some also are naturally speedy and have a strong desire to rush into situations rather than worrying about looking ahead. Elvaans with this racial trait receive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/run-final/\">Run</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces noble upbringing and martial background.</li>\n<li>Illusion Resistance:&nbsp;Elvaans are normally fearless in battle, though some of their kind train specifically against the effects of illusionists. Elvaans gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusion spells or effects. This racial trait replaces fearless.</li>\n<li>Long-Limbed:&nbsp;Elvaans with this racial trait have a base move speed of 35 feet. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Resistant:&nbsp;Spending years training their mind against the invasion of other&rsquo;s influences, an elvaan protects all aspects of themselves during combat. Elvaans gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and poison. This racial trait replaces gatecrasher.</li>\n<li>Slender:&nbsp;Elvaans often appear unnaturally thin by other races&rsquo; standards. Elvaans with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks, on combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple, and to CMD against grapples. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Spirit of the Waters:&nbsp;Some elvaans have adapted to life in tune with the sea or along the reedy depths of wild rivers and lakes. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks, can always take 10 while swimming, and may choose Aquan as a bonus language. They are proficient with longspear, trident, and net. This racial trait replaces noble upbringing and weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Urbanite:&nbsp;Elvaans who live in cities for more than a century can grow to know the ebb and flow of social situations just as their forest-dwelling cousins know the rules of the wild. Elvaans with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks made to gather information and Sense Motive checks made to get a hunch about a social situation. This racial trait replaces keen senses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Elvaan Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">elvaan</span>s follow the general model of the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">standard elvaan</span>, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 4 different potential heritages for&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">elvaan</span>&nbsp;PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating an&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">elvaan</span>, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Ability:&nbsp;While most&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">elvaan</span>s&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">focuses their hatred for orcs and goblins</span>, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a different ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Elvaan Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-650\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Heritage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Ability Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Alternate Ability</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Duskwight</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2 STR, +2 INT, -2 CHA</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">Whenever characters with this trait benefit from concealment or full concealment due to darkness or dim light, they gain a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Stealth checks.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">Duskwight Elvaan have spent decades in the peace and seclusion of various caves and caverns, resulting in acute senses one would expect from living in the darkness.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Ishgardian</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2 STR, +2 CHA, -2 WIS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">+1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the elvaan and draconic subtypes due to special training against these hated foes.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">As a result of long decades of ceaseless warfare with the Dravanian Horde, the intensity of the faith of the Church of Halone, and years of bitter cold and snow, Ishgardian Elvaans tend to be much more intense compared to their brethren, and much more devoted.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">San d'Orian</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2 STR, +2 WIS, -2 INT</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35%;\">Once per day, when an elvaan is brought below 0 hit points but not killed, he can fight on for 1 more round as if disabled.

See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Immunity to Undeath:&nbsp;Immortals can&rsquo;t become undead nor are they affected by death spells and effects. Spells and abilities that would transform&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">immortals</span>&nbsp;into an undead creature have no effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Integrated:</span><span lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;Immortals gain a +1 racial bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Knowledge (local) checks.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Long-Lived:&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"en-US\">Immortals remember bits of their long lives. As a result, they treat all Knowledge skills as class skills.</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Sociable:</span><span lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;When immortals attempt to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude with a Diplomacy check and fail by 5 or more, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magical Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Linking:&nbsp;As a full-round action, once per day, immortals can link with a non-immortal spellcaster (must be willing and only one individual at a time) to gain some of their powers. Doing so allows immortals to cast 1 spell from the non-immortal spellcaster&rsquo;s spell list (the character level of the immortal must be double of a spell level of the spell to learn) as a spell-like ability once per day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Immortal:&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Immortals</span>&nbsp;suffer none of the drawbacks and gain none of the benefits of aging. They never die of natural causes, and they are immune to any attacks or effects that ages a character.</li>\n<li>Undying:&nbsp;I<span lang=\"en-US\">mmortals</span>&nbsp;respond slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Immortals</span>&nbsp;with 0 hit points is disabled, just like any living creature.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">They</span>&nbsp;can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. However, when their hit point total is -1 or lower, immortals are inert (instead of dying) regardless of any abilities that would otherwise keep them conscious such as the Die Hard feat, ferocity, or similar abilities.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">They are</span>&nbsp;unconscious and helpless, and they cannot perform any actions. However, inert&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">immortals</span>&nbsp;do not lose additional hit points (unless more damage is dealt to them).&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Immortals</span>, whose negative hit point total drops to or below their Constitution score, do not die like any living creature, they instead gain 1 permanent negative level and fast healing equal to half their character level until back to 0 hit points or higher. This negative level stacks up to their character level &ndash; 1. If the maximum number of negative levels are reached, they instead remain inert until cured of a negative level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Magic Ineptitude:&nbsp;Immortals are inept with magic. They are unable to obtain a magic pool nor can they use spell-trigger items, spell-completion items, command word activated item, or use activated items except through their linking (see above).&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Immortal</span>s can use alchemical items and may activate and deactivate their magic weapons and armor without issue as well as gain bonuses from static magical wondrous items and rings like belts of giant strength.</li>\n<li>Not of this Plane:&nbsp;An immortal&rsquo;s connection to the Material Plane can be severed and altered, causing a weakness to occur where they did not anticipate. If subject to a successful dispel check (DC 10 + their hit die + their Wisdom modifier), without any current active effects, they are knocked unconscious for a number of rounds equal to the CL of the enemy who used the dispel. Likewise, any Immortal caught in an anti-magic field or similar effect is knocked unconscious until their body leaves the vicinity of the effect. Immortals are also affected by any spells that negatively affect outsiders or summoned creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Background Character:&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Immortal</span>s who stay away from others are more adept at blending in or hiding away rather than fitting in.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Immortal</span>s with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Disguise, Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Stealth checks. This racial trait replaces integrated.</li>\n<li>Blank Slate:&nbsp;Some&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">immortals</span>&nbsp;are bereft of memories of their long lives but can accomplish great improvisations.&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Immortals</span>&nbsp;with this racial trait can, once per day as a&nbsp;free action, treat any skill as though they had a number of ranks equal to half of their character levels for one skill check (minimum 1 rank). This racial trait replaces&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">long-lived</span>.</li>\n<li>Explorer:&nbsp;Many&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">immortal</span>s are obsessed with seeing as much of the world as possible, rather than perfecting some specific talent or vocation. These&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">immortal</span>s gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim checks and these skills are always considered class skills. This racial trait replaces&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">long-lived</span>.</li>\n<li>Emissary:&nbsp;Some immortals work to make others believe a single statement rather than improve relations. Once per day,&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">immortal</span>s may roll twice on a single Bluff or Diplomacy check and take the better roll. This racial trait replaces sociable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to immortals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/sword-saint/archetypes/sworn-protector/\">Sworn Protector</a>&nbsp;(Sword Saint; Immortal)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/\">Archer</a>:&nbsp;Add +1/4 to the archer&rsquo;s damage rolls with bows and crossbows.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/beastmaster/\">Beastmaster</a>:&nbsp;Add +1 hit point or +1 skill rank to the beastmaster&rsquo;s animal companion.

They gain a +2 racial bonus on profession (miner) checks.</li>\n<li>Metalworker:&nbsp;The galka have worked with metals most of their lives.

At the end of his next turn, unless brought to above 0 hit points, he immediately falls unconscious and begins dying.</li>\n<li>Hated:&nbsp;Due to their history of war and being exploited, the galka gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against antica and hume.</li>\n<li>Relentless:&nbsp;Galka gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to bull rush or overrun an opponent. This bonus only applies while both the Galka and its opponent are standing on the ground.</li>\n<li>Weapon Familiarity:&nbsp;Galka are proficient with the War pick and Galkan racial weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Galka have low-<wbr />light vision allowing them to see twice as far as humes in dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Architectural Ingenuity:&nbsp;Some galka demonstrate incredible talent for building and adjusting structures. These galka gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks and on Craft and Perception checks related to structures (including structural traps). This racial trait replaces metalworker.</li>\n<li>Beastmaster:&nbsp;Some galka have a spiritual kinship with fantastical beasts, capturing them for sport or living and hunting with them. A galka with this trait treats whips and nets as martial weapons and gains a +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks. This racial trait replaces ferocity.</li>\n<li>Cavewight:&nbsp;Some galka live far below the surface, seeking freedom in winding cave complexes. Galka with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Survival checks made underground. This racial trait replaces the imposing figure.</li>\n<li>Chain Fighter:&nbsp;Some galka have escaped from slavery and reforged the chains of their imprisonment into deadly weapons. Galka with this racial trait are proficient with flails and heavy flails, and treat dire flails and spiked chains as martial weapons. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>City-<wbr />Raised:&nbsp;Galka with this racial trait know little of their galka ancestry and were raised among humes and other galka in a large city. City-<wbr />raised galka are proficient with whips and longswords, and receive a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Darkvision:&nbsp;Some galka have lived in the underground depths for so long they have given up on light entirely and gained darkvision with a range of 60 feet. This racial trait replaces low-<wbr />light vision and metalworker.</li>\n<li>Scavenger:&nbsp;Some galka eke out a leaving picking over the garbage heaps of society, and must learn to separate rare finds from the inevitable dross. Galka with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks and on Perception checks to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine whether food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste. This racial trait replaces imposing figure.</li>\n<li>Stoic:&nbsp;Some galka learn to suppress their strong emotions. They don&rsquo;t usually gain morale bonuses, but instead gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against emotion and fear effects, and the DC to intimidate them increases by 2. They can choose to gain morale bonuses when they would normally be able to do so, but if they do, they lose the benefits from this racial trait for 24 hours. This racial trait replaces intimidating and ferocity.</li>\n<li>Tenacious:&nbsp;City-dwelling galka must often be tenacious to get by. Once per day, if a galka fails a Fortitude save, Will save, or Constitution check, he can reroll the save or check. The galka must take the second result, even if it is worse. This racial trait replaces ferocity.</li>\n<li>Wary:&nbsp;Many galka have spent their long lives moving from place to place, often driven out by the hostility of others. Such experiences have made them wary of others&rsquo; motivations. Galka with this trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Sense Motive and Bluff checks. This racial trait replaces metalworker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Feats</h2>\n<p>The following feats are available to a galka character who meets the prerequisites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/beast-rider-galka\">Beast Rider</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/bullying-blow\">Bullying Blow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/ferocious-action-galka\">Ferocious Action</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/ferocious-resolve-galka\">Ferocious Resolve</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/ferocious-tenacity-galka\">Ferocious Tenacity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/galka-weapon-expertise-galka\">Galka Weapon Expertise</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/horde-charge-galka\">Horde Charge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/improved-surprise-follow-through-galka\">Improved Surprise Follow-<wbr />Through</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/ironhide-bangaa-dwarf-galka\">Ironhide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/resilient-brute-galka\">Resilient Brute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/reverse-feint-galka\">Reverse-<wbr />Feint</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/surprise-follow-through-galka\">Surprise Follow-<wbr />Through</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/tenacious-survivor-galka\">Tenacious Survivor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/trap-wrecker-galka\">Trap Wrecker</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to galkas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/chocobo-knight/archetypes/fell-rider/\">Fell Rider</a>&nbsp;(Chocobo Knight; Galka)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/monk/archetypes/ironskin-monk/\">Ironskin Monk</a>&nbsp;(Monk; Galka)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/thief/archetypes/skulking-slayer/\">Skulking Slayer</a>&nbsp;(Thief; Galka)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/\">Archer</a>:&nbsp;Add +1/4 to the archer&rsquo;s damage rolls with bows and crossbows.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/astrologian/\">Astrologian</a>:&nbsp;Add +1/2 to any one Knowledge skill.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/bard/\">Bard</a>:&nbsp;Add +1 to the bard&rsquo;s total number of bardic performance rounds per day.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/beastmaster/\">Beastmaster</a>:&nbsp;Add +1 to an animal companion&rsquo;s CMD when adjacent to the beastmaster.

Tea is a known intoxicant to the Namazus, making Xaela tea ceremonies difficult for them to perform.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/beastman-tribes/namazu/\">View Namazu on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">12 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(13 &ndash; 16 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(13 &ndash; 18 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d6 years<br />(14 &ndash; 24 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">20 years</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">30</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">40</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d20<br />(41 - 60 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li>At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2 ft. 8 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d4 in.<br />(2 ft. 10 in. &ndash; 3 ft. 4 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">30 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d4 lbs.)<br />(32 &ndash; 38 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2 ft. 8 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d4 in.<br />(2 ft. 10 in. &ndash; 3 ft. 4 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">25 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d4 lbs.)<br />(27 &ndash; 33 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">Standard Racial Traits</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Traders and craftspeople, the Namazus use their small size to be nimble, dexterous, but are quite frail.

This trait replaces skilled traders and their normal movement speed.</li>\n<li>Focused Study: What Namuzus lack in strength, they make up for in skills of the trade, theft, sneaking around and, of course, running like the wind. At 1st, 8th, and 16th level, Namuzus gain Skill Focus in a skill of their choice as a bonus feat. This racial trait replaces festive culture and skilled traders.</li>\n<li>Gregarious: Extremely good at making bargains and earn the trust of even the most vile of fiends.

This racial trait replaces craftsman knowledge.</li>\n<li>Whiskersense:&nbsp;The Namuzus&rsquo; whiskers are sensitive to vibrations in the air or water within 60 ft around them. Its quite possible that not even the Namazus realize this and just act on it. If a Namuzus&rsquo; whiskers have been separated from the Namazus&rsquo; face, the whiskers will still quiver when there is something around them and can last for weeks until they shrivel up and stop working. Namuzus with this racial trait gain tremorsense in a 30-ft/-radius around themselves on the ground and in the water.

{"_id":"nnHsflpbGb6I7VIA","name":"Shindroid","permission":{"default":0,"e1nAgjLmIKiSwmCp":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Shindroids appear to be almost hume, but these artificial wonders are of a completely foreign and utterly alien nature. Shindroids are created, not born, and come into the world fully mature. The strange, alien forges in which new shindroids are created are hidden in Shinra facilities, and most have little to no memories of their &ldquo;birth&rdquo; places. Strange circuitry-<wbr />like markings that look like faintly glowing tattoos, a faint metallic sheen to the eyes, and watery, almost translucent red blood are all ways to tell a shindroid from a hume&ndash;providing its awkward mannerisms haven&rsquo;t revealed the truth already.</p>\n<p>Some shindroids are built to serve their masters, while others are sold to interested buyers looking for loyal servants. As utilities, their usefulness is boundless, and most shindroids are content to perform their assigned duties without question. Shindroids make able security guards, couriers, gardeners, shuttle pilots, expendable soldiers, and even nannies.</p>\n<p>Much to the chagrin of their creators, some shindroids are not content to serve. Perhaps due to some flaw in their construction, they choose to pursue a different path and strive to gain experiences that will lend meaning to their existence. Although Shinra have an interest in capturing and demolishing free-<wbr />willed shindroids, most societies in general have greater concerns to worry about. Consequently, many freethinking shindroids are given a chance to chase their dreams if one assumes they even have them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/shindroid/\">View Shindroid on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">0 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d2 years<br />(1 &ndash; 2 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d3 years<br />(1 &ndash; 3 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(1 &ndash; 4 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li>Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li>Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aging</h2>\n<p>Shindroids are unaging and therfor are not effected by aging effects.</p>\n<h2>Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 9 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d10 in.<br />(4 ft. 11 in. &ndash; 6 ft. 5 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">110 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(2d10x5 lbs.)<br />(120 &ndash; 210 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;Shindroids have swift reflexes and are very intelligent, but have difficulty relating to others. As a result, shindroids gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence, but suffer a &ndash;2 penalty to Charisma.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Shindroids are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Constructed (Ex):&nbsp;For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type, shindroids count as both humanoids and constructs. Shindroids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against mind-<wbr />affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects; are not subject to fatigue or exhaustion; and are immune to disease and sleep effects. Shindroids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear effects and all emotion-<wbr />based effects.</li>\n<li>Base Speed:&nbsp;Shindroids have a base speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Shindroids begin play speaking Common.

They never die of natural causes, and they are immune to any attacks or effects that age a character.</li>\n<li>Self-<wbr />Sustained:&nbsp;Shindroids do not eat, drink or breathe. Therefore, they are immune to the effects of starvation, suffocation and thirst. On the other hand, shindroid have no sense of smell or taste, and they cannot benefit from the effects of consumable spells or magic items. A shindroid can still use oils and potions as long as they don&rsquo;t heal hit points, unless they have the Living Construct feat (see below).</li>\n<li>Undying:&nbsp;A shindroid responds slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. A shindroid with 0 hit points is disabled, just like any living creature. He can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. However, when his hit point total is &ndash;<wbr />1 or lower, a shindroid is inert (instead of dying). He is unconscious and helpless, and he cannot perform any actions. However, an inert shindroid does not lose additional hit points (unless more damage is dealt to him). A shindroid, whose negative hit point total drops to or below its Constitution score, dies like any living creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotionless:&nbsp;Shindroids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a &ndash;4 penalty on Sense Motive checks.</li>\n<li>High Maintenance:&nbsp;Shindroids healed by healing spells and effects works at 50% efficiency except spells and effects that grant fast healing. They, however, do not benefit from the Heal skill. But, shindroids can be repaired by the Repair skill.</li>\n<li>Magic Ineptitude:&nbsp;Shindroids are inept with magic. They are unable to obtain MP nor can they use spell-trigger items, spell-completion items, command word activated item, or use activated items. Shindroids can use alchemical items and may activate and deactivate their magic weapons and armor without issue as well as gain bonuses from static magical wondrous items and rings like belts of giant strength.</li>\n<li>Rejuvenation Cycle:&nbsp;A shindroid runs on energy cells that need to rejuvenate regularly. During a 24-<wbr />hour period, it must shut down for 8 hours to replenish its energy supply. During its rejuvenation cycle, the shindroid is essentially asleep. If it fails to rejuvenate, it suffers a cumulative &ndash;<wbr />1 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws each day until it fully recharges itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following racial traits replace existing shindroid racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anomaly: Sometimes, a particularly volatile soul can overwhelm the technology of a shindroid body, making the resulting individual subject to emotions, and greatly so. Anomalous shindroids suffer a &ndash;2 racial penalty on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects, emotion effects, and fear effects but can gain the benefits of morale bonuses and suffer no penalty on Sense Motive checks. Additionally, Bluff and Sense Motive are always class skills for them. This racial trait modifies constructed and replaces emotionless.</li>\n<li>Body Double:&nbsp;Rather than combat, the shindroid was created to resemble a specific creature of the same size category. The shindroid does not take a racial penalty to Charisma and it gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate that creature. Some shindroid of this type are capable of sleeping, though they do not require it. This racial trait replaces part robot, emotionless, and composite plating.</li>\n<li>Endure Elements:&nbsp;Some shindroids have well-insulated interiors. A shindroid with this racial trait is permanently affected as if by an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/e/endure-elements\">Endure Elements</a>&nbsp;spell that cannot be dispelled. This racial trait replaces composite plating and part robot.</li>\n<li>Factual: While most shindroids have difficulty processing emotions, others instead have an inability to imagine things outside of physical and factual reality, making it difficult for them to deceive others. Such shindroids suffer a &ndash;4 penalty on Bluff checks. This racial trait replaces emotionless.</li>\n<li>Force Field:&nbsp;A force field sheathes a shindroid in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants a number of bonus hit points equal to 5 x the character level of the shindroid. All damage dealt to a shindroid with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. These temporary hit points are not affected by damage reduction and elemental resistance. As long as the force field is active, the shindroid is immune to critical hits but not to precision damage. A force field has fast healing equal to half the shindroid&rsquo;s character level (minimum 1), but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours. This racial trait replaces part robot, perceptive and composite plating.</li>\n<li>Heavy Platform:&nbsp;Some shindroids were constructed to operate heavy machinery and transport heavy loads, being designed with an extra robust &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; analogue. This increases the weight of the Shindroid by +50 lbs and reduces their base speed by -10 ft (from 30 to 20), but in return their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. This racial trait replaces the shindroid&rsquo;s movement speed.</li>\n<li>Infiltration Unit:&nbsp;A shindroid with this racial trait has to eat and drink like normal humanoids. They are also able to benefit from potions and oils. This racial trait replaces self-sustained.</li>\n<li>Integrated Weaponry:&nbsp;A shindroid has a 1-handed firearm built into its arm, it treats such weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons attacks, and cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. Integrated weaponry can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts), but as a general rule cannot be harvested for use outside of the shindroid&rsquo;s body once the shindroid is destroyed. A shindroid is always proficient with its integrated weapons. Integrated ranged weapons do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat. A shindroid&rsquo;s core can process scrap metal into new ammunition, effectively giving the shindroid infinite ammo with these weapons. This racial trait replaces composite plating and natural weapons.</li>\n<li>Ironspy: Shindroid bodies built for stealth and infiltration employ camouflage circuitry. Shindroids with this trait reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving at full speed by 5 and reduce the Stealth check penalty for sniping by 10. This racial trait replaces composite plating.</li>\n<li>Magitek Unit:&nbsp;A shindroid obtains an essence of magitek technology, allowing it to be able to obtain MP and activate magical items. This racial trait replaces composite plating, part robot, and magic ineptitude.</li>\n<li>Race Simulation:&nbsp;For some shindroids, the blood of a particular race flows through their body, emulating that race to better infiltrate or blend in easier. Shindroids with this racial trait chooses another humanoid race. They count as both shindroid and that race for any effects related to race. For example, if a shindroid chooses dwarf, he is considered both a shindroid and a dwarf for the purpose of taking traits, feats, how spells and magic items affect you, and so on. In addition, shindroids with this racial trait age as that chosen race, gaining the benefits and penalties of aging. This racial trait replaces immortal.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"en-US\">Repair Droid</span>:&nbsp;Some shindroids are more&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">incline with repairing themselves</span>. A shindroid with this racial trait gains a +2 to&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">Repair</span>&nbsp;and is considered a class skill for them. This racial trait replaces perceptive.</li>\n<li>Technologically-Knowledgeable:&nbsp;Some shindroids are more knowledgeable about technology. A shindroid with this racial trait gains a +2 to Knowledge (Technology) and is considered a class skill for them. This racial trait replaces perceptive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Shindroid Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">shindroid</span>s follow the general model of the standard&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">shindroid</span>, many more do not.

Knowledge, power and personal growth can be attained by eating and discovering new knowledge of food. They have somewhat limited attention spans and wit, despite not being stupid at all, but won&rsquo;t try to understand what is beyond their own limits. They are grounded in reality and won&rsquo;t be impaired by the chaos around them or dramatic events. Qus are tall, bulky humanoids with a pale, milky skin. Their almost featureless body is covered by strong muscles and healthy fat. Their round belly occupies most of their body mass, their most powerful asset. Their bulbous head and short, stumpy legs generally make them above 6 feet tall. Their long, lanky arms hang to the sides of their body when left unattended. The Qu&rsquo;s faces are commonly described as &ldquo;a gross, doll-<wbr />looking face with rounded, cross-<wbr />shaped eyes and a wound-<wbr />like mouth going side to side, gifted with a tongue larger than my arm.&rdquo; They favor brightly colored clothes and cook outfits, and usually weigh about 400 pounds.

Nu mous with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Banganese, Celestial, Draconic, Giant, Moogle, Sylvan and Vieran. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enfeebling Resistance:&nbsp;Nu mous receive a +2 bonus on saving throws against enfeebling spells and effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sagacious:&nbsp;Nu mous receive a +2 racial bonus on any two Knowledge skills.

Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated:&nbsp;Many nu mous are skilled in the art of ingratiating themselves into a community as if they were natives. Nu mous with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Knowledge (local) checks. This racial trait replaces sagacious.</li>\n<li>Lorespeaker:&nbsp;Most nu mous are knowledgeable on a wide variety of topics, but a lorespeaker recalls knowledge forgotten by others. A nu mou with this racial trait adds half his class level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge skill checks and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained. This racial trait replaces sagacious.</li>\n<li>Magic Resistant:&nbsp;Some nu mous are particularly resistant to magic. Nu mous with this racial trait gain spell resistance equal to 10 + their character level. This resistance can be lowered for 1 round as a standard action. This racial trait replaces adept and overwhelming caster.</li>\n<li>Power Master:&nbsp;Nu mous train for years to become adaptable to all weapons that are surrounded by magic. Nu mous gain proficiency with all Power Weapons. If the nu mou gains proficiency with any of these weapons from their favored class, they gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with those specific weapons. This racial trait replaces adept.</li>\n<li>Sociable:&nbsp;Nu mous are skilled at charming others and recovering from faux pas. If nu mous with this racial trait attempt to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude with a Diplomacy check and fail by 5 or more, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed. This racial trait replaces sagacious.</li>\n<li>Sociable Intellectual:&nbsp;Some nu mous, though still excellent scholars, are able to hold discourse more effectively, though they lack the common sense common to the race. Nu mous with this racial trait gain +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma and -2 Constitution. This racial trait replaces their standard ability scores.</li>\n<li>Threats Known:&nbsp;Rather than study history or magic, some nu mous learn all they can of various creatures and races. A nu mou with this racial trait can make an appropriate Knowledge check when first encountering a foe. A successful check grants the nu mou the normal benefits of such a check, plus one of the following benefits for 1 minute: +4 initiative, +1 dodge to AC, +2 to one saving throw versus a known attack or ability. Making this check is a free action. If a nu mou spends a move action when making this check, he can impart the benefit to an ally instead of himself. This racial trait replaces adept and overwhelming caster.</li>\n<li>Truespeaker:&nbsp;There are some nu mous whose language transcends all boundaries. They gain a +2 bonus on Linguistics and Sense Motive checks, and they learn two languages each time they gain a rank in Linguistics. This racial trait replaces well-<wbr />spoken.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Feats</h2>\n<p>The following feats are available to a nu mou character who meets the prerequisites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/arcane-talent/\">Arcane Talent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/breadth-of-experience\">Breadth of Experience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/servitors-diplomacy\">Servitor&rsquo;s Diplomacy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to nu mous:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/hybrid-classes/scholar/archetypes/academician/\">Academician</a>&nbsp;(Scholar; Nu Mou)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/thief/archetypes/eldritch-raider/\">Eldritch Raider</a>&nbsp;(Thief; Nu Mou)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/red-mage/archetypes/elemental-knight/\">Elemental Knight</a>&nbsp;(Red Mage; Nu Mou)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/illusionist/archetypes/spellshaper/\">Spellshaper</a>&nbsp;(Illusionist; Nu Mou)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/astrologian/\">Astrologian</a>:&nbsp;Add one spell known from the astrologian spell list.

Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ancestral Arms:&nbsp;Some half-breeds receive training in an unusual weapon. Half-breeds with this racial trait receive Exotic Weapon Proficiency or Martial Weapon Proficiency with one weapon as a bonus feat at 1st level. This racial trait replaces&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">the feat and skill or offense racial trait</span>.</li>\n<li>Dual Minded:&nbsp;The mixed ancestry of some half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breeds</span>&nbsp;makes them resistant to mental attacks. Half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breed</span>s with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws. This racial trait replaces the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">defense</span>&nbsp;racial trait.</li>\n<li>Eye for Opportunity:&nbsp;Constantly facing the rough edges of two societies, some half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breed</span>s develop a knack for finding overlooked opportunities. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attacks of opportunity. This racial trait replaces the defense racial trait.</li>\n<li>Mismatched:&nbsp;Rather than having bodily and facial features that are a blend of&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">both races</span>, or tending towards one parent or the other, a rare few half-breeds have a strange combination of features. They have noticeable mismatched eyes and ears, as well as uneven limbs. Half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breed</span>s with this trait take a &ndash;2 penalty on Reflex saves but receive a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces the feat and skill racial traits.</li>\n<li>Scavenger:&nbsp;Forced to survive on their own as outcasts, some Half-Breeds learn to make do with what little they have. Half-Breeds with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise and Perception checks to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine whether food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste. This racial trait replaces multitalented.</li>\n<li>Sociable:&nbsp;Half-<span lang=\"en-US\">breed</span>s are skilled at charming others and recovering from faux pas. If half-breeds with this racial trait attempt to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude with a Diplomacy check and fail by 5 or more, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed. This racial trait replaces the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">feat and skill</span>&nbsp;racial trait.</li>\n<li>Stubborn:&nbsp;Some Half-breeds, either due to prejudice or being physically or mentally inferior to one of their parent&rsquo;s races, learn to overcome their circumstances through sheer, unbridled willpower. Half-Breeds with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Will saving throws to resist spells and spell-like abilities of the enfeebling school. In addition, if a half-breed fails such a save, it receives another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming the spell or spell-like ability has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the half-breed has a similar ability from another source, it can only use one of these abilities per round, but can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails. This racial trait replaces multitalented.</li>\n<li>Wary:&nbsp;Many half-breeds have spent their long lives moving from place to place, often driven out by the hostility of others. Such experiences have made them wary of others&rsquo; motivations. half-breeds with this trait gain a +1 racial bonus on Sense Motive and Bluff checks. This racial trait replaces the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">feat and skill</span>&nbsp;racial trait.</li>\n<li>Water Child:&nbsp;Some half-breeds have adapted to life on or near the water. These half-breeds gain a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks, can always take 10 while swimming, and may choose Aquan as a bonus language. This racial trait replaces the&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">feat and skill</span>&nbsp;and multitalented racial traits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

Despite their outward appearance, Gria are driven by a love for battle and many have fierce competitive spirits. Gria resemble Humes with draconic features. They have pointed ears, slender, upward pointed horns, short, thin tails, and draconic, scaly wings. Their draconic features are usually brown in color, but are sometimes green or red. They typically have red hair and yellow, slitted eyes. Although their limbs look to be slender, Gria possess powerful inner strength and athleticism. Male Gria have longer tails and larger horns and wings than their female counterparts. Gria have a somewhat matriarchal society in that females tend to be more active and outgoing than male members. While male Gria certainly exist, they prefer more peaceful and less dangerous jobs, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that Males don&rsquo;t go out and explore, of course, but a large majority of Gria seen questing are female. Most Gria are fine in the company of other races, their competitive and friendly spirit making them difficult to dislike, but their villages tend to host only members of their race.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/gria/\">View Gria on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

They gain +2 Strength, +2 Charisma, and &ndash;<wbr />2 Wisdom.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Gria are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Gria are Humanoid creatures with the gria subtype.</li>\n<li>Base Speed:&nbsp;Gria have a base speed of 30 feet on land. While gria wings are too small to provide true flight, the same magic that empowers dragons allows gria to achieve limited flight for short periods of time while wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. A gria can fly with clumsy maneuverability a number of rounds at a time equal to her Constitution bonus. A gria can attempt to fly for longer durations by making Constitution check each additional round of flight (DC 10 + 2 per extra round). A gria&rsquo;s natural fly speed is equal to her base land speed. After flying, a gria must rest a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent flying before flying again.</li>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Gria begin play speaking Common and Draconic. Gria with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Banganese, Giant, Goblin, Ignan, Seeq, Terran. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fearless:&nbsp;Gria receive a +2 racial bonus on saves against fear spells and effects.</li>\n<li>Stubborn:&nbsp;Gria gain a +2 racial bonus on Will saving throws to resist spells and spell-like abilities of the illusion school. In addition, if a gria fails such a save, it receives another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming the spell or spell-like ability has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the gria has a similar ability from another source, it can only use one of these abilities per round, but can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Athleticism:&nbsp;Gria are naturally fit and nimble. They receive a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks.</li>\n<li>Diplomatic:&nbsp;Gria receive a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks.</li>\n<li>Survivalist:&nbsp;Gria receive a +2 racial bonus on Survival checks.</li>\n<li>Martial Background:&nbsp;Gria receive the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat-final/\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feat for free at first level, and may apply it to any single weapon they are proficient in.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Destructive:&nbsp;&nbsp;Gria receive a +2 racial bonus on sunder combat maneuver checks.</li>\n<li>Weapon Familiarity:&nbsp;Gria are proficient with the knight sword and longbow (including composite).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Gria can see twice as far as humes in conditions of dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bestial:&nbsp;The draconic blood of some gria manifests in the form of particularly prominent gria features, exacerbating their bestial appearances but improving their already keen senses. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. This racial trait replaces diplomatic.</li>\n<li>Desert Runner:&nbsp;Some gria thrive in the deepest deserts, forever roaming across burned and parched lands. Gria with this racial trait receive a +4 racial bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves to avoid fatigue, exhaustion, or ill effects from running, forced marches, starvation, thirst, or hot or cold environments. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Dual Minded:&nbsp;The draconic ancestry of some gria makes them resistant to mental attacks. Gria with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws. This racial trait replaces fearless and weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Erdane Guardian:&nbsp;Bending the earth to their will was the calling of the ancient gria earth mages. A gria who follows the calling of her ancestors gains a +2 bonus to Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (geography) checks. These are considered class skills for the gria with this racial trait. This racial trait replaces athleticism and survivalist.</li>\n<li>Ferocity:&nbsp;Some gria give themselves over completely to their race&rsquo;s aggressive tendencies, channeling their competitive spirit into a bloodlust. Once per day, when brought below 0 hit points but not killed, a gria can fight on for 1 more round as if disabled. At the end of her next turn, unless brought to above 0 hit points, she immediately falls unconscious and begins dying. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.</li>\n<li>Fleet-<wbr />Footed:&nbsp;While all gria are naturally lithe and agile, some also are naturally speedy and have a strong desire to rush into situations rather than worrying about looking ahead. Gria with this racial trait receive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/run-final/\">Run</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces survivalist and martial background.</li>\n<li>Skymaster:&nbsp;Some gria defy their conflicted nature and take to the skies, avoiding war, peace, and civilization all together. A gria with this racial trait gains a +2 bonus to Fly and Pilot skill checks. This racial trait replaces athleticism and survivalist.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Gria Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many grias follow the general model of the gria, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 4 different potential heritages for gria PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a gria, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Movement:&nbsp;While most grias have a Fly movement speed, those of the variant heritages listed below have an alternate racial movement ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Gria Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-478\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Heritage</th>\n<th>Ability Modifiers</th>\n<th>Alternate Movement</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cave Wyrm</td>\n<td>+2 CON, +2 WIS, -2 CHA</td>\n<td>Loses the ability to fly, but gains a Climb Speed equal to half movement speed and can glide.</td>\n<td>These gria live in subterranean environments and are used to climbing walls and gliding through the air on their weakened wings.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Draconic</td>\n<td>+2 STR, +2 WIS, -2 DEX</td>\n<td>Flight maneuverability increases from clumsy to poor.</td>\n<td>Some gria were chosen and raised by dragons that they resemble.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ocean Wyrm</td>\n<td>+2 DEX, +2 CHA, -2 WIS</td>\n<td>Loses the ability to fly, but gains a Swim Speed equal to movement speed and the Amphibious trait.</td>\n<td>These gria were born and raised by the ocean, having long forsaken their ability to fly, and instead, using their wings to swim and glide through the water.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sand Wyrm</td>\n<td>+2 DEX, +2 WIS, -2 STR</td>\n<td>Loses the ability to fly, but can glide with a +10 movement speed.</td>\n<td>These gria were raised in the desert, adopting a desert nomad life.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Racial Feats</h2>\n<p>The following feats are available to a gria character who meets the prerequisites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/skilled-flyer-gria-moogle\">Skilled Flyer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/feats/racial-feats/strengthened-wings-moogle-or-gria/\">Strengthened Wings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Racial Archetypes</h2>\n<p>The following racial archetypes are available to grias:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/bard/archetypes/dragon-herald/\">Dragon Herald</a>&nbsp;(Bard; Gria)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/base-classes/berserker/archetypes/dragoner/\">Dragoner</a>&nbsp;(Berserker; Gria)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/thief/archetypes/trickster/\">Trickster</a>&nbsp;(Thief; Gria)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<p>The following favored class options are available to all characters of this race who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/bard/\">Bard</a>:&nbsp;Add +1 to the bard&rsquo;s CMD when resisting a disarm or sunder attempt.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/beastmaster/\">Beastmaster</a>:&nbsp;Add +1 hit point or +1 skill rank to the beastmaster&rsquo;s animal companion.

{"_id":"vja2uoNQlLe2fxTm","name":"Antica","permission":{"default":0,"e1nAgjLmIKiSwmCp":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The anticas have transformed the former Galkan capital of Altepa into the central location of their empire, which spreads across the islands of Kuzotz. Their militaristic society is built upon advanced personnel management abilities. Upon birth, all individuals are given a number, and a job for which they spend the rest of their lives training. Apart from the information needed to perform their duties, the individual is not allowed any other knowledge. An antica is only allowed to transfer positions to become a gladiator (used for population control).</p>\n<p>The anticas have no concept of personal belongings. All equipment is provided by the Empire, and food rations are based solely on the duties performed by the individual. However, due to their lack of emotion, there is not a single antica who feels discontent towards this system. This can also be seen on the battlefield. No matter the situation, the lack of fluctuation in morale is the antica&rsquo;s greatest strength.</p>\n<p>Another strength lies in the sheer number of antica soldiers. In addition to their active legions, an enormous surplus of soldiers lies in stasis within the antica&rsquo;s stronghold. When revived, the size of their army can increase a hundredfold. However, due to their lack of naval technology, only a few of their troops were able to participate in the Great War campaigns carried out on Quon; their presence had little effect on the outcome of the battles. It is widely believed that had the full Antican army participated in the battles on Quon, the allied forces surely would have been defeated.</p>\n<p>While the antica communicate by fricative sounds made within their necks, they are unable to release loud war cries like the other beastmen. This results in an eerie silence on the battlefield that can send chills down the spine of even the bravest warrior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/beastman-tribes/antica/\">View Antica on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

Roegadyns with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus to CMD.

This racial trait replaces cornered fury.</li>\n<li>Sea Legs:&nbsp;Many roegadyns find their way onto the water early in their youth, whether they live with trader families, work as smugglers, or plunder alongside pirates. These roegadyns receive a +2 racial bonus on Swim checks, as well as a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to move on narrow or slippery surfaces, and on Climb checks on docks and ships. This racial trait replaces imposing figure.</li>\n<li>Stoic:&nbsp;Some roegadyns learn to suppress their strong emotions.

Due to the nature of their creation, the majority of the Genome population lack a soul, and have little to no emotional response; Genomes are nothing more than empty husks awaiting the attainment of a soul. A Genomes existence is perpetually incomplete until they receive a soul. As such, the collective Genome existence is dedicated to the preparation of attaining a soul, mentally and physically. The Genomes also seem to know a great deal of the Soul Cycle and the world in which they live. Although this knowledge is useless to a vessel who will soon forget what they have learned upon receiving a soul, information is circulated among the population to prevent mental decay. The Genomes harbor production facilities in which they create more of their race. Through these production facilities, they aim to create a more suitable vessel for a soul to reside in. This could also be interpreted as somewhat recreational due to their seemingly meaningless existence. Genomes are normally isolated, creating villages around their production facilities. Because of this, when a Genome attains a soul, it is not uncommon for them stay with their own kind. A Genome found away from one of these villages was probably sent to procure knowledge for the creation of more perfect Genomes. Genomes typically come in two forms, Terran and Gaian. Terran Genomes often have long flexible tails, and blonde hair, while Gaian Genomes often look dark, with shadowed faces, bright yellow eyes, and a greater aptitude in magic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/genome/\">View Genome on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

Because of their naivety, genomes with this trait also take a -2 penalty on all Sense Motive Checks. This racial trait replaces technological instinct and isolated, as well as changing the Racial Ability Scores to: +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, and -2 Wisdom.</li>\n<li>Mystic Vessel:&nbsp;A genome with this trait has high aptitude for magic, and considers his caster modifier +1 higher for purposes of determining bonus MP. The genome also gains a +2 racial bonus to Spellcraft and Knowledge (Arcana) skill checks. This racial trait replaces ideal vessel and dexterous tail.</li>\n<li>Resilient Soul:&nbsp;A genome with this trait chooses one of the following: Fortitude, Reflex, or Will.

For reasons unknown, after their exile from the Black Shroud, new generations of Ixal have lacked pinion feathers. Having lost their ability to fly, they use balloons for transporting cargo throughout mountain passes. Thus their engineering and crafting abilities are highly used to build more and maintain the balloon transportation. Their main stronghold is Natalan, located east of Camp Dragonhead in the Coerthas Highlands. As befitting their reverence for the Lady of Vortexes, the Ixal have an affinity to using wind magic, and her blessings power the airstones that guide their airships.</p>\n<p>They frequently make excursions into the Black Shroud to obtain timber, both for practical use and as religious service to Garuda. These activities have earned the ire of the elementals, and by extension the city-state of Gridania, leading to frequent clashes. In contrast, their encroachment into Coerthas has been generally dismissed as a secondary concern by the Holy See of Ishgard, who are too preoccupied with the holy war against the Dravanian Horde to deal with Natalan.

Furthermore, mithra gain a +1 bonus to their CMD against trip maneuvers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fleet-Footed:&nbsp;Mithra receive Run as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks.</li>\n<li>Natural Hunter:&nbsp;Mithra receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Movement Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sprinter:&nbsp;Mithra gain a 10-<wbr />foot racial bonus to their speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Mithra have low-<wbr />light vision allowing them to see twice as far as humes in dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cat&rsquo;s Claws:&nbsp;Some mithra have stronger and more developed claws than other members of their race, and can use them to make attacks. Mithra with this racial trait have a pair of claws they can use as natural weapons. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.</li>\n<li>Clever Cat:&nbsp;Mithra&rsquo;s generally friendly disposition doesn&rsquo;t preclude craftiness. Some of them see social obstacles as games to be played and won. These mithra receive a +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.</li>\n<li>Climber:&nbsp;Mithra hunters excel at hunting prey from trees and other high vantage points. Mithra with this racial trait possess a climb speed of 20 feet (along with the +8 racial bonus on Climb checks a climb speed affords). This racial trait replaces sprinter.</li>\n<li>Curiosity:&nbsp;Mithra are naturally inquisitive about the world around them, though some are more curious than others. Such mithra gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) are always class skills for them. If they choose a class that has either of these Knowledge skills as class skills, they gain a +2 racial bonus on those skills instead. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.</li>\n<li>Dexterous Tail: Mithra with this trait have a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action. This racial trait replaces sprinter.</li>\n<li>Jungle Stalker:&nbsp;Mithra often live in deeply forested terrain and they have become naturally sure-footed to maintain their hunting prowess in these dangerous environments. Such mithra gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks and can ignore the first square of difficult terrain caused by foliage each round. This racial trait replaces cat&rsquo;s luck and sprinter.</li>\n<li>Miqo&rsquo;te Heritage:&nbsp;These mithra are not threatened by the Yagudo, but by the Ixal. Mithra with this racial trait gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC versus Ixal enemies. This racial trait replaces lesser defensive training.</li>\n<li>Scent:&nbsp;Some mithra favor a keen sense of smell over sensitive sight. Mithra with this racial trait gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">scent</a>&nbsp;ability. This racial trait replaces the low-<wbr />light vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Mithra Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many mithras follow the general model of the standard mithra, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability. Here are 8 different potential heritages for mithra PCs. If you choose to use a specific bloodline instead of the general rules for creating a mithra, you should work with your GM to ensure that your character&rsquo;s appearance reflects that bloodline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternate Skill Modifiers:&nbsp;While most mithras gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks, those of the variant heritages listed below gain a modifier to different skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Table: Variant Mithra Heritages</h2>\n<table id=\"tablepress-83\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Heritage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Ability Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Alternate Skill Modifiers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Cheetara</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+4 DEX, -2 STR, -2 CON</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Fast and lithe, these speedy mithra seek a fun life in the fast lane.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Jagara</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 WIS, +2 INT, -2 CON</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Knowledge (Arcana), Spellcraft, Use Magic Device</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Wily and knowledgeable, these mithra want to understand the ways of magic.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Keepers of the Moon</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 DEX, +2 WIS, -2 STR</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Acrobatics, Stealth, Survival</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Shying from the garish light of day, they revel in the shroud of night, with most offering their piety to the moon.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Liono</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 STR, +2 CHA, -2 WIS</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (Nobility)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Loyal and royalty-borne, these mithra seek to unite all mithra races.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Panthro</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 STR, +2 INT, -2 CHA</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Disable Device, Drive, Knowledge (Technology)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Strong and smart, these mithra want to build unique vehicles and expand technology</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Pumyra</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 DEX, +2 WIS, -2 CON</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Craft (Alchemy), Heal, Sense Motive</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Sleek and wise, these mithra seek to heal the wounded.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Seekers of the Sun</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">+2 DEX, +2 CHA, -2 INT</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Acrobatics, Bluff, Perform (Dance)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55%;\">Lithe and agile, these diurnal Mithra seek the warm light of the day.

Mandragoras can heal up to 2 hit points per level per day with this ability, after which it ceases to function.</li>\n<li>Natural Armor:&nbsp;Their plant-<wbr />like nature has gifted mandragoras with a fibrous, stiff skin much like bark. This grants them a +1 natural armor bonus.</li>\n<li>Plant Resistance:&nbsp;While technically a plant, a mandragora has more in common with most humanoids. They gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-<wbr />affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), paralysis, poison, and polymorph effects. They are immune to sleep effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Camouflage:&nbsp;Mandragoras gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks while in marshes or forested terrains.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Magical Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Tune with the Earth:&nbsp;Mandragoras are treated as 1 level higher when casting spells with the earth descriptor. This ability does not give mandragoras early access to level-<wbr />based powers; it only affects powers that they could already use without this ability.</li>\n<li>Spell-<wbr />Like Ability (Su):&nbsp;Mandragoras can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/p/photosynthesis\">photosynthesis</a>&nbsp;once per day as a spell-<wbr />like ability (caster level equal to the mandragora&rsquo;s class level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Movement Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Terrain Stride:&nbsp;Mandragoras ignore natural difficult terrain within forests and move at their normal speed within said environments. Magically altered terrain affects them normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Offense Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Shriek:&nbsp;Once per day as a standard action, a mandragora can give voice to an unsettling shriek. All creatures within a 30-<wbr />foot spread of a shrieking mandragora must make a Will save (DC 10 + half of the mandragora&rsquo;s character level + its Wisdom modifier) or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-<wbr />affecting ability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bioluminescence:&nbsp;At will, a mandragora can cause any part of his body to glow, giving off light as a torch.</li>\n<li>Sunlight Sustenance:&nbsp;A mandragora does not eat food, but must consume water like all living things. As long as it receives at least six hours of sunlight per day, a mandragora requires only 1/4th the water a normal humanoid would. A mandragora deprived of adequate sunlight for more than two days at a time becomes fatigued until it gets at least six hours of sunlight. If it does not get sunlight for more than a week, it becomes exhausted until it gets at least six hours of sunlight. A one hour exposure to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/daylight\">daylight</a>&nbsp;spell will fulfill a mandragora&rsquo;s daily needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-<wbr />Light Vision:&nbsp;Mandragoras can see twice as far as humes in conditions of dim light.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weakness Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Temperature Vulnerability:&nbsp;A mandragora has trouble regulating its body temperature. Mandragoras have a &ndash;<wbr />4 penalty to Fortitude saves made against environmental effects.</li>\n<li>Vulnerable to Fire:&nbsp;Mandragoras take 150% as much damage as normal from fire attacks, unless they are immune to fire via other special defenses.</li>\n<li>Weakened by Cold:&nbsp;As the winter slows the growth of trees, it also tires and weakens the mandragora. If a mandragora suffers ice damage, it withers and wilts, needing to make a Fortitude save equal to 10 + the half the damage suffered. Failure to save means the mandragora is staggered for 1 round.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<p>The following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buoyant:&nbsp;Mandragoras with this racial trait lived by the water. They gain a +4 competence bonus to Swim checks and a 20-foot swim speed. This racial trait replaces camouflage and in tune with the earth.</li>\n<li>Burned One:&nbsp;You survived a forest fire or being struck by lightning. You gain your choice of fire or lightning resistance 5. Once chosen, this choice cannot be changed. This racial trait replaces plant resistance and vulnerable to fire.</li>\n<li>Cactuar Kin:&nbsp;Your clan&rsquo;s ancestors were desert-<wbr />dwelling cactuars. The whole of your body is covered with small spines. When you are struck with a natural weapon or unarmed strike, your opponent suffers 1d3 points of piercing damage. You also deal this damage to your opponent each round while grappling. This racial trait replaces plant resistance.</li>\n<li>Dark Root:&nbsp;Your lineage is more closely related to tubers and other root plants than to soaring sequoia or grand oaks. You gain darkvision 60 feet and a burrow speed of 15 feet. This racial trait replaces low-<wbr />light vision and bioluminescence.</li>\n<li>Evergreen:&nbsp;You grew up in harsh climates, where the winds were harsh and the cold biting, but that only served to numb those pains. You gain your choice of ice or wind resistance 5. Once chosen, this choice cannot be changed. This racial trait replaces plant resistance and weakened by cold.</li>\n<li>Malboro Kin:&nbsp;Your clan&rsquo;s ancestors were the poison-spewing Malboro. You have Water Resistance 5, and you exude a powerful stench, causing creatures who share a square with you, have swallowed you whole or creatures with Scent who are within 10 feet, must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the Mandragora&rsquo;s character level + its Constitution modifier) or become Sickened for 1 round. Creatures who make the save become immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a Poison effect. This racial trait replaces elemental resistance and plant resistance.</li>\n<li>Pestilent:&nbsp;Your lineage began in a stagnant swamp. You gain immunity against poison and disease. This racial trait replaces plant resistance.</li>\n<li>Photosynthetic Regrowth:&nbsp;A mandragora with this racial trait recovers lost hit points every hour rather than every day as long as it remains in direct sunlight for the entire hour. This racial trait replaces natural armor.</li>\n<li>Pithy Toughness:&nbsp;Mandragoras with this racial trait gain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/toughness-final/\">Toughness</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. This racial trait replaces plant resistance.</li>\n<li>Thick Bark:&nbsp;Mandragoras with this racial trait have a thicker skin around their bodies. They gain a +1 racial bonus to Fortitude saves and a +2 save bonus vs. fire attacks. This racial trait replaces plant resistance and vulnerable to fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Variant Mandragora Heritages</h3>\n<p>Although many&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">mandragora</span>s follow the general model of the standard&nbsp;<span lang=\"en-US\">mandragora</span>, many more do not.

This, however, has long been disputed, with scholars citing several distinct differences in the two races as evidence of decidedly dissimilar roots&mdash;the first and foremost being the enhanced hearing and spatial recognition granted by auri&rsquo;s cranial projections (traits not attributed to draconian horns), and the second being the gross disproportion of body mass between auri males and females (again, a trait widely unseen in dragons). The auri are split into two clans, the Raen and Xaela.</p>\n<p>Auri creation myth tells of a Dawn Father and a Dusk Mother from whom all auri are descended. The Raen believe their veins to run thick with the blood of the former&mdash;their brilliant white scales and iron wills serving as proof of this divine lineage. The Xaela believe their veins to run thick with the blood of the latter&mdash;their lustrous black scales and fiery wills serving as proof of this divine lineage.</p>\n<p>Raen, unlike their sister clan, the Xaela, who bloody the land with their endless tribal conflict, have embraced a life of tranquility and solitude, long abandoning the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors to settle the deep valleys of Othard&rsquo;s mountainous eastern reaches. Only on rare occasions will one emerge from the valley mists to seek adventure in realms afar. The Xaela however, are free spirits who roam the vast western steppe in close-<wbr />knit tribes hunting, gathering, and warring as their ancestors have for countless generations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/base-races/au-ra/\">View Au Ra on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Adulthood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Intuitive</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Self-Taught</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Trained</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">12 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d4 years<br />(13 &ndash; 16 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 years<br />(13 &ndash; 18 years)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+2d6 years<br />(14 &ndash; 24 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Intuitive&nbsp;includes Astrologians, Beastmasters, Gamblers, Geomancers, Illusionists, and Thieves.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Self-Taught&nbsp;includes Archers, Bards, Black Mages, Dragoons, Fighters, Gunners, Necromancers, Summoners, and White Mages.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">Trained includes Blue Mages, Chemists, Clerics, Dark Knights, Engineers, Holy Knights, Knights, Medics, Monks, Red Mages, and Time Mages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Aging</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Middle Age</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Old</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Venerable</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">Maximum Age</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">30 years</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">35</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">60</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 25%;\">+2d10<br />(62 - 80 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At middle age, -1 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At old age, -2 to Str, Dex and, Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\">At venerable age, -3 to Str, Dex, and Con scores and +1 to Int, Wis and Cha scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Height and Weight</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gender</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Height</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Height Modifier</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Base Weight</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Weight Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Male</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">6 ft. 3 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d6 in.<br />(6 ft. 4 in. &ndash; 6 ft. 9 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">185 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d6x8 lbs.)<br />(193 &ndash; 233 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Female</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">4 ft. 9 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+1d8 in.<br />(4 ft. 10 in. &ndash; 5 ft. 5 in.)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">115 lbs.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">+(1d8x4 lbs.)<br />(119 &ndash; 147 lbs.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Racial Traits:&nbsp;The Raen and Xaela clans have different attributes.

Violently devout and ritualistic, the yagudos are a race of religious zealots, their society appearing to be based on a strict religious hierarchy. Yagudos evince little technological development, living instead in austere constructions of wattle-and-daub, as well as cliffside caves. Their most formidable architectural construct is Castle Oztroja, which may be more appropriately considered a temple than a castle, for it exists as a gateway to the location of the current manifestation of their Godhead, Tzee Xicu. There&rsquo;s also the &ldquo;the avatar,&rdquo; who is second to Tzee Xicu. Dialogue refers to the Yagudo Avatar as a king while Tzee Xicu is female and the manifest seems to traditionally be a female (much like their Star Sibyl counterpart).</p>\n<p>They use few tools or weapons, except for occasional clubs and swords, and wear no armor, excepting the fact that magic-using classes cover their faces with ceremonial masks. While apparently unconcerned with efforts of conquest, as the orcish race is, the yagudo&rsquo;s primary conflict with outsiders comes as a response to disputes over the right to occupy the land which they consider to be hereditary and traditionally their own. The yagudo hold a tentative treaty of non-aggression with the tarutaru nation of Windurst, representing the only case of such between a beastman race and a developed nation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/races/beastman-tribes/yagudo/\">View Yagudo on the FFd20 site</a></p>\n<h2>Starting Age</h2>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0px\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

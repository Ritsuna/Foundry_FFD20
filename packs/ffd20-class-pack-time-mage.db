One who guides and protects them, often through enhancing their abilities to a level that even the fiercest enemy can&rsquo;t withstand. Ultimately, the time mage brings a capable protector, an experienced &lsquo;buffer&rsquo; and a solid source of damage to any party lucky enough to have one.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Time mages may be of any alignment. Because of the confusion that manipulating time often generates, many time mages are chaotic.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth:</strong> 2d6 &times; 10 gil (average 70 gil.)

{"_id":"jk91LETQWuKBUJdI","name":"Aevum","permission":{"default":0,"e1nAgjLmIKiSwmCp":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 5th level, the time mage gains the ability to control aevum&mdash;distinct moments of important time, stolen from the future and used to power the time mage&rsquo;s abilities. Unlike a mote, which is a very minor split second of time, an aevum is a more noteworthy moment, a crucial instance when something important happened. While a time mage has a ready supply of motes to spend on minor effects, aevum represent more major manipulations of time and are thereby a rarer commodity. When first gained, the time mage must select a single power from the list below, and has a single aevum per day to spend. He gains additional aevum powers at 9th, 13th, and 17th level, and also increases his daily aevum pool by +1 at each of the levels. Spending an aevum is a standard action unless the ability description says otherwise.</p>\n<p>Bolt Time (Su):&nbsp;By spending an aevum, the time mage can accelerate his movements to a speed that allows him to easily see and react to the movement of a crossbow bolt or other projectile as it flies toward a target. The time mage remains in bolt time for one round per class level. This ability counts as a haste effect. While in bolt time, the time mage gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once per round, the time mage can cast a 1st level spell as a swift action. Every four levels thereafter, the time mage can cast a spell of one higher spell level as a swift action.</li>\n<li>The time mage gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves.</li>\n<li>All of the time mage&rsquo;s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice his normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus and it affects the time mage&rsquo;s jumping distance as normal for increased speed.</li>\n<li>Each round, the time mage may automatically dodge the first ranged attack he is aware of that would otherwise strike him.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Entropy (Su):&nbsp;The time mage can force a target to suddenly feel the effects of aging, which damages and weakens it. He spends an aevum and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action against any target he can see within 100 ft. + 10 ft./time mage level. If he hits the target, it takes 1d8 points of damage per class level of the time mage (to a maximum of 15d8). This damage bypasses hardness and DR.</p>\n<p>Personal Time (Su):&nbsp;The time mage can take risky actions and, if things go badly, simply reverse his personal timeline to before he made the effort. At the beginning of his turn, the time mage spends an aevum as a free action. He then takes one normal round of actions, with all results noted temporarily. After his round of activity, before the next creature&rsquo;s turn begins, the time mage must decide if he is going to keep the round of activity he just took, or rewind himself. If he keeps the round of activity, any changes made to any character during his turn become permanent. If he decides to reverse his timeline, he goes back to the moment he spent the aevum, and all changes that occurred during his round are erased from all creatures and items. The time mage is left with a standard action, but is considered to have spent an aevum and made use of his move action already. No one but the time mage remembers actions that took place during a round of time he reverses. If a time mage is killed or knocked unconscious during a round of personal time, he automatically reverses back to the beginning of his turn.</p>\n<p>Preferred Timeline (Su):&nbsp;The time mage can rewind time by small amounts to erase any minor mistakes he makes as a result of distraction around him. By spending an aevum, the time mage can use skills reliably even under adverse conditions. Once he spends the aevum, he can take 10 on any skill check made over the next hour, even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so.</p>\n<p>Reverse Timeline (Su):&nbsp;By spending an aevum, a time mage can draw information from his future or past, allowing him to instantly gain the benefits of considerable study and reflection. He can also peer briefly into the future to see how others react to his various attempts at negotiation or subterfuge. The time mage can make a single ability check or skill check with a result equal to 20 + his total ability or skill bonus.</p>\n<p>Shatter Time (Su):&nbsp;The time mage can break up the bigger, more important moments of stolen time under his control into smaller, more easily manipulated pieces. By spending an aevum, the time mage can recharge his daily uses of motes. He regains a number of motes of time equal to 1d4 + his Intelligence modifier. This cannot increase the number of motes available to above his daily mote total.</p>\n<p>Temporal Stasis (Sp):&nbsp;Once per day, the time mage can spend an aevum to attempt to inflict&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/t/temporal-stasis/\">temporal stasis</a>&nbsp;(as the spell of the same name) on one touched creature. The time mage uses his class level as his caster level for this ability. If the time mage&rsquo;s initial touch attack fails, he can attempt this again as a standard action until he succeeds or six rounds pass. Once she successfully touches a target he loses the ability to try again, even if the target makes its Fortitude save.&nbsp;Prerequisite:&nbsp;A time mage must be at least 17th level to select this aevum ability.</p>\n<p>Time Cross (Su):&nbsp;The time mage can focus his timeline-<wbr />stealing powers on a target, and steal from it a moment of success. He spends an aevum to make a ranged touch attack against any target he can see within 100 ft. + 10 ft./time mage level. If the time mage misses with this ranged attack he can try again (with each new attempt being its own standard action) for up to one minute per level. Once a target is hit, as an immediate reaction, the time mage can force the target to re-<wbr />roll a single attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw he is aware of that occurs while the time cross is active (a time period equal to one minute per time mage level). The target must take the result of the second roll. After the target re-<wbr />rolls once, the ability is discharged regardless of the outcome of the re-<wbr />roll.</p>\n<p>Time Stop (Sp):&nbsp;Once per day, the time mage can spend an aevum to create a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/t/time-stop/\">time stop</a>&nbsp;effect (as the spell of the same name) on himself.&nbsp;Prerequisite:&nbsp;A time mage must be at least 17th level to select this aevum ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[["Support"]],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":"See Aevum chosen"},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"day","autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"floor([[@classes.timeMage.level]]-1/4)"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"aevum","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"featType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":[["Time Mage"]]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"su","crOffset":""},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

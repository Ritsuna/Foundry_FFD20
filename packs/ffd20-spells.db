Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light. If daylight is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell&rsquo;s effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Daylight brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Daylight counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness and blacklight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/d/daylight/\">Daylight</a></p>","spellDuration":"10 minutes/level (D)","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"@sl"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1},"flags":{"importid":"FtoXi3KcLDn0N9w8"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by dispel. Dispel can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel can take effect.</p>\n<p>You choose to use dispel in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.</p>\n<p>Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p>\n<p>For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p>\n<p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p>\n<p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p>\n<p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item&rsquo;s caster level (DC = 11 + the item&rsquo;s caster level). If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties.

This darkness causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in darkness. Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of darkness. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than darkness. If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell&rsquo;s effect is blocked until the covering is removed. This spell does not stack with itself.

This darkness causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness.

All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in darkness. Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of darkness. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than darkness.

If the poison has no onset time, its frequency is doubled, requiring two saving throws and inflicting damage twice per round or minute, though its duration is halved. Accelerate poison does not change the cure condition for the poison. If the target is affected by more than one poison, you may choose which is affected if you administered the poison; otherwise, randomly determine which poison is affected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/magic/spells/a/accelerate-poison/\">Accelerate Poison</a></p>","spellDuration":"instantaneous","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"@sl"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1},"flags":{"importid":"A3xg8sR8SKkFvIgl"},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

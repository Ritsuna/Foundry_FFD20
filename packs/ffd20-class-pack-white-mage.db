The world while filled with beautiful and wondrous landscapes is still fraught with disaster. Conflict, and war are only one of these disasters, casting a shadow of misery and pain in their wake.

While some seek to hurt and maim, the white mage chooses a life of compassion only seeking to harm when absolutely necessary. The white mage finds purpose in protecting their allies, often by empowering their abilities and enhancing attributes to a height previously unattainable. When all this preparation and protection isn&rsquo;t enough the white mage is there with their gentle healing embrace, mending the wounds of their comrades.</p>\n<p>Role: White mages provide excellent support, from keeping their allies up and ready with healing spells, such as cure and regen, keeping their defenses sharp with spells such as shell and protect, negating various status effects with esuna and dispel, and even flagging down bonuses foes get with deprotect and deshell. Additionally, white mages can serve as deadly, if one-note damage dealers, capable of blasting down foes with spells like light and holy.
